      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective. Instead, a mean reversion strategy could be more suitable, aiming to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, supports this approach. The strategy will use these indicators to identify potential entry and exit points within the range. The balanced buy/sell ratio indicates that there isn't a clear market bias, further supporting a non-directional, mean-reverting approach. Given the low volatility, the strategy will employ tighter stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage risk effectively while aiming for smaller, more frequent gains. The overall moderate risk level of the market, due to potential sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes, necessitates careful position sizing and risk management.",
