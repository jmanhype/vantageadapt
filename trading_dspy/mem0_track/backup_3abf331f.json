      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic opportunities for substantial gains but is also fraught with risks of losses. Therefore, a strategy that focuses on risk management while attempting to capture potential high-reward opportunities is advisable.\n\nConsidering these factors, a cautious approach with a focus on capital preservation is recommended. The strategy should employ tight stop losses to minimize potential losses and a moderate take profit to ensure profits are captured without expecting excessively large movements. The use of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, combined with a low position size, will help manage risk. A combination of trend-following indicators (like moving averages) and oscillators (like RSI) can be used to identify potential trading opportunities in this uncertain market.",
