      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PnL per trade, indicating some strategies have been successful under current or similar conditions. However, the overall win rate is very low (3.08%), suggesting a high level of risk or a potentially misleading statistic (as typical win rates are expressed in percentages, not multiples). This discrepancy suggests a cautious approach is warranted.\n\nGiven these conditions, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal as the primary action, indicating no new positions should be initiated until clearer market conditions emerge. The strategy parameters will be set conservatively to ensure that if the market conditions become more favorable and clear, the strategy can pivot quickly to take advantage with minimal risk.",
