      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective, and instead, mean reversion strategies could be more suitable. The strategy will aim to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end, or vice versa for short positions, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to its average. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, supports the idea that the market is in equilibrium, making sudden large moves less likely. Therefore, a cautious approach with tight stop losses and modest take profit targets is advisable to manage risk while exploiting the market's current behavior.",
