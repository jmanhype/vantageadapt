      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that the market might be experiencing high volatility or that the strategies employed previously were high risk. The strategy will focus on capital preservation and risk management while trying to capture moderate gains. Given the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, a neutral strategy such as a mean reversion or a low-frequency trend-following strategy with tight risk controls is advisable. The strategy will employ a moderate position size to manage risk effectively, use tight stop losses to protect against large adverse movements, and set realistic take profit levels to ensure profitability. The strategy will also incorporate both technical and fundamental analysis to identify entry and exit conditions, aiming to improve the win rate and overall profitability.",
