      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL and a significant overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the current market environment. However, the lack of specific regime information necessitates a strategy that can perform well in both trending and ranging markets. Therefore, the strategy will focus on risk management, using tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to protect gains and limit losses. The strategy will employ a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, with a focus on moving averages to gauge trend direction and strength, and RSI to identify overbought or oversold conditions that may signal a reversal or pullback. The strategy will be dynamic, adjusting position sizes based on the strength of the signal and current market volatility, with a default to a conservative position size due to the unknown market conditions.",

      "exit_conditions": [
        "Exiting a buy position when RSI > 70 or price drops below the stop loss level, indicating overbought conditions or a loss beyond the risk tolerance.",
        "Exiting a sell position when RSI < 30 or price exceeds the take profit level, indicating oversold conditions or a gain meeting the profit target."
