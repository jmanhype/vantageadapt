  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close alignment of SMA20 and SMA50 supports the use of these indicators for identifying entry and exit points within the range. Since the RSI is fluctuating around the mid-range, it suggests that the market is not in an overbought or oversold condition, which aligns with the strategy of trading within the range rather than expecting breakout movements.\n\nThe strategy should be conservative, given the low volatility and the ranging nature of the market, focusing on small, consistent gains rather than large trades. This approach is supported by the recent performance data, which shows a positive average return and P&L, indicating that a strategy focusing on small, consistent trades could be successful in the current market conditions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the trade signal will be set to HOLD until specific entry conditions are met, reflecting a cautious approach in a low-volatility, ranging market. The strategy will aim to enter trades when there is a clear indication of a short-term trend within the range and exit before the market reverses or hits the range boundaries.",
