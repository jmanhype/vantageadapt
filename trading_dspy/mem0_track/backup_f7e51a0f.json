      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PNL and a win rate, suggesting that some strategies have been effective in the current market conditions. However, the lack of specific regime information requires a strategy that can perform well in various market conditions. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy might be suitable, as it does not rely heavily on trend direction and can capitalize on small price movements. The strategy will use technical indicators to identify overbought and oversold conditions, aiming to buy low and sell high within a defined range. Given the unknown market conditions, maintaining a moderate position size and employing tight stop loss and take profit levels will be crucial for risk management. The strategy will also include dynamic adjustments based on market volatility and liquidity to enhance its adaptability.",
