      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high overall win rate and positive average PnL, indicating that the market, despite its uncertainties, has been profitable for certain strategies over the last 7 days. In such a scenario, a conservative approach is advisable, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. A strategy that employs tight risk management, with a focus on small, consistent gains rather than large bets, would be prudent. The strategy will use basic technical analysis indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, with a bias towards maintaining a neutral position until a clearer market trend is identified.",
