  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, suggests that the market lacks a clear direction. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective in this environment. This strategy will aim to buy at low points within the range and sell at high points, using technical indicators to identify these entry and exit points. The strategy will use tighter stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively, given the low volatility and the potential for sudden changes in direction. The use of RSI (Relative Strength Index) will be incorporated to identify overbought and oversold conditions, complementing the SMA indicators for entry and exit signals. The strategy will maintain a moderate position size to manage risk, considering the market's moderate risk level and the potential for volatility spikes.",
