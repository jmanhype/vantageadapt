      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PNL and a high overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the current market. However, the lack of specific regime information requires a strategy that can perform well in both trending and ranging markets. Therefore, a dual approach strategy will be employed, focusing on mean reversion in low volatility conditions and momentum in high volatility conditions. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify market conditions and adjust its approach accordingly. RSI and Bollinger Bands will be used to identify overbought and oversold conditions for mean reversion trades, while MACD and moving averages will be used to identify trending conditions for momentum trades. The strategy will maintain a conservative position size and employ tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to manage risk effectively.",
