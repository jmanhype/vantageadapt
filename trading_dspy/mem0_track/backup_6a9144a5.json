      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while some trades are highly profitable, the majority are not successful. This scenario calls for a strategy that aims to improve the win rate while maintaining a reasonable level of profitability per trade.\n\nConsidering the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, a mean reversion strategy might be too risky without clear indicators of overbought or oversold conditions. Instead, focusing on a low-frequency, high-quality trade approach could be more suitable. This would involve identifying strong, high-probability setups based on a combination of technical and fundamental analysis, rather than relying on frequent, smaller trades.\n\nThe strategy will employ a conservative position size to manage risk effectively, given the unknown market conditions. A tight stop loss will be set to minimize potential losses on each trade, and a modest take profit level will aim to capture gains while avoiding the risk of holding for too long in a market that may shift rapidly.",
