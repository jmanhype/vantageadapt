      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain or that there is insufficient data to determine a clear market trend or volatility regime. In such scenarios, a conservative approach is advisable, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The strategy should be flexible, capable of adapting to both potential market directions and volatility levels. Considering the recent performance data, which shows a positive average return and PNL, it's evident that some strategies have been successful under current or similar conditions. However, the overall win rate suggests a cautious approach is warranted.\n\nA strategy that employs tight stop losses to protect capital and modest take profit levels to ensure gains are realized in uncertain market conditions would be prudent. Position sizing should be conservative to manage the risk of significant losses. The strategy could use a combination of technical indicators known for their effectiveness in various market conditions, such as moving averages for trend direction, RSI for overbought/oversold conditions, and Bollinger Bands for volatility assessment. Entry and exit conditions should be based on these indicators, ensuring trades are only executed when there is a higher probability of success.",
