      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade but with a low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario calls for a strategy that prioritizes capital preservation and risk management while still allowing for profit in uncertain market conditions.\n\nA mean reversion strategy might be too risky without a clear understanding of the market regime. Instead, a more conservative approach that focuses on high-probability setups and strict risk management is advisable. The strategy will involve waiting for clear signals of overbought or oversold conditions before entering trades, ensuring that trades are only entered when there is a high chance of success.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy will maintain a neutral stance with a HOLD signal until more definitive market conditions emerge.",
