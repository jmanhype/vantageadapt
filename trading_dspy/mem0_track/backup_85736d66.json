      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while most trades are not profitable, a few trades have generated significant returns. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic volatility spikes or trend reversals, making it challenging to predict. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, employing a cautious approach until a clearer market direction is established.\n\nGiven these conditions, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal initially, focusing on monitoring the market for clearer signals of direction or volatility changes. The strategy parameters will be set conservatively to ensure that if a trade is taken, the risk is minimized.",
