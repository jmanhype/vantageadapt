      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade, but the overall win rate is suspiciously low (2.54%), which might indicate a data error or an extremely high-risk strategy that is not sustainable. Therefore, the strategy developed will aim for a balanced approach, targeting moderate returns while minimizing risk exposure. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, focusing on high-probability trades rather than high-frequency trading. Given the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy will maintain a neutral stance (HOLD) until more definitive market conditions emerge.",
