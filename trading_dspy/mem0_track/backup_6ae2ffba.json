      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and PNL, indicating some strategies have been successful under current or similar conditions. However, the overall win rate is unusually reported (over 3, which seems to be a mistake since win rates are typically expressed as a percentage under 1), suggesting a potential error in data reporting or interpretation. Without clear market direction and with potentially unreliable performance data, the strategy will focus on capital preservation and risk management.\n\nThe strategy will employ a cautious approach, using a low position size to minimize exposure. Stop loss and take profit levels will be tight, reflecting the strategy's conservative nature and the need to protect against sudden market movements in an unknown regime. Entry and exit conditions will be based on technical analysis, using indicators that do not rely heavily on market direction, such as moving averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold signals. This approach allows for flexibility, enabling the strategy to adapt to market changes.",
