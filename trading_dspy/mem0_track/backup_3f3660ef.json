      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade and an overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. However, the lack of specific market regime information necessitates a strategy that can perform well under various conditions. Therefore, a flexible mean reversion strategy that can adapt to changing market conditions is proposed. This strategy will focus on identifying overbought and oversold conditions within a short to medium-term timeframe, aiming to capitalize on small, corrective price movements. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, with a strong emphasis on risk management to protect against unknown market risks.",
