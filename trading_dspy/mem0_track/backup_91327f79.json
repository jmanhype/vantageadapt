      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade and a significant overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. Without specific details on market trends, volatility, or direction, a conservative approach focusing on risk management and capital preservation is advisable. A strategy that can adapt to changing conditions without relying heavily on predicting market direction would be prudent. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy might be suitable, as it does not depend on long-term directional trends and can capitalize on short-term fluctuations. This strategy will aim to identify overbought and oversold conditions as entry points, assuming that the price will revert to the mean. Position size will be kept moderate to manage risk, with tight stop losses to protect against large losses and take profit levels set to ensure profits are captured during short-term price movements.",
