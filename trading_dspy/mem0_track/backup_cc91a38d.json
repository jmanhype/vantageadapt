      "reasoning": "Given the market context lacks specific regime identification, confidence level, and risk level, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should be flexible, capable of adapting to both bullish and bearish market conditions, and focus on capital preservation until clearer market signals emerge. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return, indicating some strategies have been effective in the current market. Therefore, the strategy will aim to capitalize on short-term movements with tight risk management controls to protect against volatility and uncertain market conditions.",
