      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and the low volatility indicates that price movements are likely to be smaller and less erratic. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be suitable, aiming to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end. The strategy will use technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought and oversold conditions within this range, combined with moving averages to confirm the price direction within the short-term range. The strategy will maintain tight stop-loss levels to protect against sudden market moves out of the range, and take-profit levels will be set to capture modest gains within the range. Position size will be conservative due to the moderate risk level and the potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes as noted in the market analysis.",
