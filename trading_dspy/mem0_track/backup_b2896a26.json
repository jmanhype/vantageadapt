      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade and a positive overall P&L, indicating that some strategies have been successful under current or similar conditions. However, the overall win rate is low, suggesting a high variance in outcomes. This scenario calls for a strategy that can adapt to various market conditions while minimizing risk. A possible approach is to employ a mean reversion strategy in markets showing range-bound behavior and a momentum strategy in trending markets, using technical indicators to identify the market state. The strategy will use a moderate position size to balance between capitalizing on opportunities and managing risk. The stop loss and take profit levels will be set conservatively to protect against large losses and lock in profits in an uncertain market environment.",
