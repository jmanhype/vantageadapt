      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic opportunities for gains amidst generally uncertain conditions. Therefore, the strategy will focus on identifying high-probability setups, employing tight risk management to protect against losses in an unpredictable market.\n\nThe strategy will use a combination of technical analysis for entry and exit signals, emphasizing the quality of trades over quantity. Given the lack of clear market direction, the trade signal will be HOLD until specific, high-confidence setups are identified.",
