  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, suggests that the market lacks a clear direction. Therefore, a mean-reversion strategy might be more appropriate than a trend-following strategy in this scenario. The strategy will use tighter stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively in a low volatility environment. The use of SMA indicators for entry and exit signals will help identify potential reversals within the range. The strategy will maintain a moderate position size to manage risk while allowing for potential profit from small price movements.",
