  "reasoning": "Given the current market context of a RANGING_LOW_VOL regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within a defined range. The low volatility and neutral RSI suggest that the market is not trending strongly in either direction, making it suitable for a range-bound trading strategy. The recent performance indicates a negative average return, which highlights the need for careful risk management. The strategy will employ a conservative approach with a focus on small position sizes and tight stop losses to mitigate potential losses while allowing for small gains.",
