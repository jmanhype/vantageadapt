      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data suggests a high overall win rate and a positive average PnL, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the current market. However, without specific details on the market conditions that led to this performance, the strategy will prioritize risk management and adaptability.\n\nThe strategy will employ a HOLD signal initially, as the market regime and risk level are unclear. This cautious approach is to avoid entering trades without a clear understanding of market conditions. The strategy parameters will be set conservatively to minimize risk in case market conditions become more defined and provide a clearer direction.",
