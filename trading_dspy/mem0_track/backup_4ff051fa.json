      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic opportunities for significant gains but is also fraught with risks of losses. Therefore, a strategy that focuses on risk management while attempting to capture potential high-reward opportunities is advisable.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, a HOLD signal is most prudent until more definitive market conditions can be identified. The strategy should focus on preserving capital and maintaining a position to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. The strategy parameters should be set conservatively to manage the unknown risk effectively.",
