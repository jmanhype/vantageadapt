  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA20 and SMA50 to the current price, along with RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, suggests that the market lacks a strong directional trend. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective in this environment. This strategy will aim to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to its average price level.\n\nThe strategy will use tight stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively, given the low volatility and the potential for sudden changes in direction. The position size will be conservative to manage the risk further, considering the market's recent performance, which shows a negative average PNL and a low overall win rate.",
