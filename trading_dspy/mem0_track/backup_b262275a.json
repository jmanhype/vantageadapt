      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade and an overall win rate of 3.08%, which is quite low. This indicates that while the trades that do win are profitable, the win rate is very low, suggesting a high-risk environment or a strategy that takes very selective trades. Based on this, the strategy should aim to improve the win rate while maintaining a reasonable level of profitability per trade.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and risk level, a mean reversion strategy might be too risky without clear indicators of overbought or oversold conditions. Instead, focusing on a strategy that can capitalize on small, consistent gains might be more appropriate, using tight stop losses to manage risk and protect against large losses. The strategy should be flexible, allowing for both buy and sell signals based on the market's immediate past performance, with a focus on short-term trades to capitalize on small movements.",
