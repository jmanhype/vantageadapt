      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and PNL, indicating some strategies have been successful under current or similar conditions. However, the overall win rate is low, suggesting a high variance in outcomes. Therefore, the strategy will aim to identify high-probability setups with a focus on minimizing losses through tight risk controls. The strategy will use a combination of technical analysis for entry and exit signals, emphasizing the importance of risk management in uncertain market conditions. Given the lack of specific market direction, the trade signal will be set to HOLD until clear, high-probability trading signals are identified.",
