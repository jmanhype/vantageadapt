      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are rare. This scenario implies a market that may have sporadic volatility spikes or unpredictable movements. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management while trying to capture gains from potential high-return trades.\n\nA conservative approach would involve waiting for clear market signals before executing trades, hence a HOLD signal is appropriate until more definitive market conditions are identified. The strategy should employ tight stop losses to protect capital and modest take profit levels to ensure profits are realized without expecting excessively large movements. Position sizing should be conservative to manage the unknown risk level effectively.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market regime and risk level, the strategy will rely on technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points, focusing on overbought and oversold conditions, trend reversals, and breakout patterns as primary signals for trade execution.",
