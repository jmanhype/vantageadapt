      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade and a significant overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent market conditions. However, without specific details on the market trend, volatility, or direction, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management.\n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy will adopt a cautious approach, focusing on small, consistent gains rather than aggressive trades. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, aiming to capitalize on minor price movements. Given the lack of clear market direction, the strategy will not favor long or short positions exclusively but will instead remain flexible, entering trades based on the strongest signals provided by the technical analysis.",
