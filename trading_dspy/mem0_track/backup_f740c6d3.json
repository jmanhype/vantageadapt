      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are rare. This scenario suggests a market that may have unpredictable swings, making it challenging to commit to a single direction (BUY or SELL) confidently. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management while trying to capture gains from potential market movements.\n\nConsidering these factors, a HOLD signal is appropriate until more definitive market conditions can be identified. The strategy will employ tight risk management parameters to ensure capital preservation. The strategy will be designed to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, ready to take advantage of clear trends when they emerge.",
