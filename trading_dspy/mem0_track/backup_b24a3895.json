      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while most trades do not succeed, the few that do are significantly profitable. This scenario suggests a market that may have brief periods of high volatility or trends that are difficult to predict but are profitable when correctly anticipated.\n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management while trying to capture gains from potential high-volatility movements. A conservative position size is recommended to mitigate risk, along with tight stop loss levels to protect against sudden adverse market movements. The take profit level should be set with a higher threshold to capture significant movements when they occur.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the unknown regime, the strategy will not commit to a specific trade signal (BUY/SELL) without further confirmation from market conditions. Instead, it will maintain a HOLD position until clear entry signals are identified.",
