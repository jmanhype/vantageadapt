      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and PNL, indicating some strategies have been successful under current or similar conditions. However, the overall win rate is unusually high, which may indicate an error in the data or an exceptionally favorable period that may not persist. Therefore, the strategy will focus on capital preservation and risk management, employing a cautious approach until more definitive market conditions emerge.\n\nThe strategy will use a combination of technical indicators that are effective across various market conditions, such as moving averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold signals, to determine entry and exit points. Given the lack of clear market direction, the strategy will not commit to long or short positions but instead look for short-term trading opportunities, adopting a HOLD signal as the default stance until clearer signals emerge.",
