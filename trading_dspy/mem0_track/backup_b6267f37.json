      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PnL and a high overall win rate, suggesting that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. However, the lack of specific market regime information requires a strategy that can perform well under various conditions. Therefore, a balanced approach that focuses on capital preservation and risk management is recommended. The strategy will employ a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, aiming to capture moderate gains while minimizing losses. Given the uncertainty in the market regime, the strategy will use a lower position size to reduce exposure, a tight stop loss to protect against sudden market movements, and a conservative take profit level to ensure gains are captured without assuming excessive risk. The strategy will be designed to adapt to changing market conditions, with the ability to switch from a focus on capital preservation to seeking higher returns if the market becomes more predictable.",
