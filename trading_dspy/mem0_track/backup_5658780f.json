  "reasoning": "The current market context indicates a strong bullish trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows, supported by a favorable RSI and moving averages. Given the bullish sentiment, the strategy will focus on entering long positions while managing risk through appropriate stop-loss and take-profit levels. The recent performance suggests a need for cautious entry, as the average return is negative, indicating potential consolidation. Therefore, the strategy will incorporate a moderate position size and conservative risk management to capitalize on upward movements while protecting against pullbacks.",
