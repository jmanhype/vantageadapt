      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests a high degree of uncertainty and unpredictability in the current market conditions. The risk level is also unknown, which adds to the challenge of formulating a precise trading strategy. However, the recent performance data indicates a positive average return and PnL, suggesting that some strategies have been successful under these conditions. The overall win rate is notably high, which could imply that the market, despite its unpredictability, has been favorable to systematic trading strategies over the past week.\n\nIn light of these factors, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, given the lack of clear market direction. A mean reversion strategy might be suitable in this scenario, as it does not rely on trend predictions but rather on the assumption that prices will revert to a mean value over time. This approach can be effective in markets with unknown regimes, as it seeks to exploit short-term fluctuations rather than predict long-term movements.",
