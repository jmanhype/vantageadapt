      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are rare. This scenario suggests a market that may have unpredictable swings, making it challenging to commit to a directional trade with high confidence. Therefore, a strategy focusing on risk management and capital preservation is paramount.\n\nConsidering these factors, a neutral (HOLD) trade signal is advised until more definitive market conditions can be identified. The strategy should employ tight risk management parameters to protect against sudden market movements. A low position size is recommended to minimize exposure while the market regime remains unclear.\n\nThe strategy will focus on high-probability setups identified through technical analysis, with entry and exit conditions designed to capture short-term movements with clear risk/reward parameters. Given the lack of clear market direction, the strategy will not commit to long-term positions but instead look for opportunities that present a favorable risk/reward ratio based on historical volatility and price levels.",
