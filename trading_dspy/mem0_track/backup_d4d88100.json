  "reasoning": "Given the current market context where the regime is unknown and there is no price data available for analysis, it is essential to proceed with caution. The recent performance indicates a negative average return and a low win rate, suggesting that any trading strategy needs to be particularly robust in terms of risk management. In such an environment, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation is recommended. The strategy will prioritize minimal risk while aiming for small, realistic gains.",
