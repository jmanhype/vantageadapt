      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario calls for a strategy that prioritizes capital preservation and risk management while still allowing for profit in uncertain market conditions.\n\nA diversified approach that spreads risk across multiple assets or sectors may reduce the impact of any single market event. The strategy should employ tight stop losses to protect against significant losses and set modest take profit levels to ensure profits are captured during short periods of favorable market movement. Given the uncertainty in market conditions, a HOLD signal is appropriate until clearer trends emerge.\n\nThe strategy will focus on technical analysis for entry and exit signals, given the lack of clear market direction. Indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD can be used to identify potential trading opportunities within this conservative framework.",
