      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are rare. This scenario calls for a strategy that minimizes risk while still allowing for capitalization on potential high-reward opportunities. \n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy will focus on risk management, employing tight stop losses to protect against large losses and modest take profit levels to ensure profits are captured without relying on large market movements. The strategy will use a cautious position size to manage exposure to the market. \n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy will default to a HOLD signal until more definitive market conditions emerge. This conservative approach prioritizes capital preservation in uncertain market conditions.",
