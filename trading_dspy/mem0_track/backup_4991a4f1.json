      "reasoning": "Given the market context lacks specific regime identification, confidence in the current market conditions, and risk level, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should focus on capital preservation while still allowing for potential gains in an uncertain market environment. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and win rate, indicating that there is potential for profitable trading, but without clear market direction, a neutral strategy focusing on short-term fluctuations might be most appropriate. Therefore, the strategy will aim to capitalize on small, short-term movements rather than betting on a longer-term trend.",
