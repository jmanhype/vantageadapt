      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. The risk level being unknown further complicates the strategy development as it's challenging to gauge the potential downside or volatility in the market. However, the recent performance data indicates a positive average PnL and a win rate, suggesting that some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. \n\nIn such an uncertain market, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management is advisable. A strategy that can adapt to various market conditions without relying heavily on a specific market regime would be suitable. Therefore, a low-frequency, mean reversion strategy might be appropriate, aiming to capitalize on small, corrective price movements rather than large trends. This strategy would involve buying on slight dips and selling on minor rallies within a broader range, using technical indicators to identify these entry and exit points.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy should employ tight risk management controls, including small position sizes, tight stop losses, and modest take profit levels. This approach aims to minimize potential losses while still capturing small gains in a market without a clear trend.",
