  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, suggests that the market lacks a clear direction. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective, aiming to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end. The strategy should employ tight stop losses due to the low volatility and potential for sudden market moves. The use of RSI as an additional indicator can help identify overbought and oversold conditions within this range, complementing the SMA indicators for entry and exit signals. The strategy should maintain a moderate position size to manage risk, given the market's moderate risk level and the potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes.",
