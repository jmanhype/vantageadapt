      "reasoning": "Given the market context lacks specific regime identification, confidence level, and risk level, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should aim to capitalize on small, consistent gains while minimizing risk, suitable for an environment where clear market direction is not established. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return, indicating some strategies have been effective in the current market. Therefore, the strategy will focus on maintaining a high win rate and managing risk through tight stop losses and moderate take profits.",
