      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade, but the overall win rate is suspiciously low (2.54%), which might be a typographical error or misinterpretation (possibly meant to be 25.4%). This discrepancy indicates a need for a strategy that prioritizes risk management and capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge.\n\nConsidering the lack of clear market direction and the high level of uncertainty, a HOLD signal is most prudent at this time. The strategy should focus on monitoring the market for clearer signals of direction and volatility before committing capital. \n\nHowever, for the purpose of preparing for potential market entry, a strategy focusing on high probability setups with tight risk controls is advisable. This could involve looking for trades that offer a high reward-to-risk ratio based on historical performance data, with strict criteria for entry and exit to minimize potential losses.",
