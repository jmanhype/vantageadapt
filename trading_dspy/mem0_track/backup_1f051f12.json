      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and flexible to adapt to potential shifts in market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PnL, indicating some strategies have been successful under current or similar conditions. However, the overall win rate is low, suggesting a high level of risk or variance in outcomes. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, employing a cautious approach until more definitive market trends emerge.\n\nConsidering the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy will employ a HOLD signal initially, with a readiness to switch to BUY or SELL signals based on specific entry conditions being met. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators that are effective across various market conditions, such as Moving Averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold signals, to identify potential entry points. The exit strategy will be based on achieving a predefined profit level or cutting losses early through a tight stop loss.",
