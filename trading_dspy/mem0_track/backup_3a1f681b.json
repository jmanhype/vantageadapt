      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while most trades are not profitable, a few trades have generated significant returns. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic volatility spikes or trend reversals, making it challenging to predict. Therefore, the strategy should focus on risk management, employing tight stop losses to protect against large losses and modest take profit levels to ensure profits are captured during favorable market movements. A cautious approach with a lower position size is advisable to manage the uncertain market conditions effectively.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the high variability in trade outcomes, a HOLD signal is recommended until more definitive market trends emerge. The strategy should be ready to adapt quickly to changing market conditions, with parameters set to minimize risk.",
