      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative in nature. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating a potentially high-risk, high-reward trading environment. The strategy will, therefore, focus on capital preservation while trying to capture gains in a potentially volatile market. Given the lack of clear market direction and risk level, a neutral strategy such as mean reversion might be appropriate, aiming to profit from small price reversals within a defined range. The strategy will use technical analysis to identify overbought and oversold conditions as entry points, with tight stop losses to protect against large adverse moves.",
