  "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range, rather than anticipating breakout trends. The convergence of SMA 20 and SMA 50, along with RSI values around the mid-range, supports a strategy that exploits short-term fluctuations. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective, where trades are entered when the price deviates from its average, expecting it to revert back. The low volatility suggests tighter stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively while aiming for smaller, more frequent gains. The strategy will use SMA and RSI as primary indicators to identify overbought or oversold conditions within the range for entry signals. The existing base parameters will be adjusted to fit the ranging market context, focusing on shorter time frames and tighter price levels for stop loss and take profit.",
