  "reasoning": "Given the current market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy focuses on capitalizing on small price movements. The analysis indicates that the price is oscillating around the moving averages (SMA20 and SMA50), and the RSI is fluctuating around the mid-range, suggesting no strong trends. Therefore, the strategy will employ a mean-reversion approach, entering trades when the price deviates slightly from the SMA20 and exiting when it reverts back or when the RSI indicates overbought conditions. The chosen parameters for stop loss and take profit are conservative, reflecting the low volatility environment, while the position size is kept manageable to mitigate risk.",
