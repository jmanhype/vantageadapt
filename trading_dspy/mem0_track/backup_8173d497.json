    "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, suggests that the market lacks a clear direction. Therefore, a strategy that does not rely on strong trends but rather on small fluctuations within the range would be appropriate. The strategy should employ tight stop losses to minimize risk due to the potential for sudden volatility spikes. A lower position size is recommended to manage risk effectively in a low-volatility environment. The use of SMA and MACD indicators, as mentioned in the base parameters, can be adapted to shorter periods to better capture the characteristics of the current market regime. The strategy will focus on buy signals, considering the overall positive recent performance and the potential for capturing gains from small upward movements within the range.",
