      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade, but without clear context on market direction or volatility, it's prudent to adopt a neutral stance. Therefore, the strategy will be centered around a HOLD signal with a readiness to adjust as soon as the market regime becomes clearer. The strategy will involve monitoring key indicators and market sentiment for signs of a more defined market regime. This approach minimizes exposure to uncertain market conditions while maintaining readiness to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. The strategy will use a very conservative position size and tight stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively in case of sudden market movements.",
