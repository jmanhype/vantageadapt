      "reasoning": "Given the market context lacks specific regime identification, confidence level, and risk level, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should be flexible, capable of adapting to both bullish and bearish market conditions, and focus on capital preservation until clearer market signals emerge. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and win rate, indicating that a strategy focusing on small, consistent gains with tight risk management could be effective. The strategy will use technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, with a focus on short to medium-term trades to capitalize on market volatility.",
