      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while some trades are highly profitable, the majority are not successful. This scenario calls for a strategy that improves the win rate while still capturing significant profits on winning trades. A balanced approach that combines trend-following for capturing larger moves with mean reversion for smaller, more frequent gains could be appropriate. The strategy will use technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points, focusing on high-probability setups to improve the win rate. Risk management will be a key focus, with tight stop losses to protect against large losses and a moderate position size to manage overall exposure.",
