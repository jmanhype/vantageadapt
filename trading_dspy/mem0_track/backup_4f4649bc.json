      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade, but the overall win rate is confusingly presented as over 3%, which may be a typographical error, typically win rates are expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100, not as a factor over 1. Assuming the intention was to convey a win rate of approximately 31.13%, this indicates a moderately successful trading background but requires clarification. Without specific market trends or conditions to guide the strategy, diversification and risk management become paramount. The strategy will employ a cautious position size, tight stop loss, and modest take profit to navigate the uncertain market. The trade signal will be HOLD until more definitive market conditions are identified, allowing for a more targeted strategy.",
