      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that a mean-reversion strategy could be effective. In such a market, prices tend to oscillate between support and resistance levels without making significant breakouts. The strategy will therefore aim to buy near support levels and sell near resistance levels, or vice versa for short positions, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to its average. The strategy will use technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify potential overbought or oversold conditions within the range, and Moving Averages (SMA_20 and SMA_50) to help define the current range and its mid-point. Given the low volatility, a tighter stop loss and a conservative take profit level are advisable to manage risk while aiming for smaller, more frequent gains. The strategy's success will rely on disciplined risk management and the ability to execute trades quickly in response to indicator signals.",
