  "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The use of moving averages (SMA) and MACD as indicators in the base parameters aligns well with this approach, as they can help identify potential entry and exit points within the range. However, adjustments are needed to better suit the current market conditions.\n\nThe strategy will maintain a conservative position size due to the moderate risk of sudden shifts in volatility or direction. A tighter stop loss is appropriate to minimize losses if the market moves out of the range unexpectedly. The take profit level is set to capture modest gains within the range without expecting large movements.\n\nTrade signals will be generated based on the convergence and divergence of moving averages and the MACD indicator, which are suitable for identifying momentum shifts within a ranging market. Entry conditions will focus on signals suggesting the beginning of a potential short-term trend within the range, while exit conditions will aim to capture profits before the trend reverses or the market breaks out of the range.",
