  "reasoning": "Given the current market context of a \"RANGING_LOW_VOL\" regime, the strategy focuses on capitalizing on small price movements within a defined range. The low volatility indicates that significant price swings are unlikely, making it suitable for a range trading strategy. The RSI's mid-range values suggest that there are no extreme conditions, allowing for potential entries at both the lower and upper bounds of the range. The close proximity of the SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price further supports this approach. The strategy will involve entering positions when the price approaches the boundaries of the range, with tight stop losses to manage risk effectively.",
