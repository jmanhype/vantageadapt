      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0 and risk level also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while most trades are not profitable, a few trades have generated significant returns. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic opportunities for substantial gains amidst generally unfavorable conditions. Therefore, the strategy should focus on identifying these rare opportunities while minimizing losses on unsuccessful trades.\n\nConsidering the lack of specific market direction and the high variance in trade outcomes, a mean reversion strategy might be too risky as it relies on predictable price movements around a mean value. Instead, a more cautious approach that uses breakout strategies could be more appropriate. This approach waits for clear market signals before entering a trade, potentially capturing significant moves while avoiding the noise in the market.\n\nThe strategy will employ tight stop losses to protect against large losses and use a moderate position size to manage risk. Take profit levels will be set ambitively to capture potential large moves, given the historical data showing significant PnL on successful trades.",
