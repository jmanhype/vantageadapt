      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PNL and a win rate, suggesting that some strategies have been effective in the current market conditions. However, the low overall win rate implies a cautious approach is warranted. The strategy will therefore aim to make small, consistent gains with tight risk controls in place. Given the lack of clear market direction, a HOLD signal is appropriate until more definitive market trends emerge. The strategy will focus on high-probability setups, employing a low position size to manage risk effectively. The use of stop loss and take profit levels will further ensure that any trades taken are exited either at a predefined loss threshold or profit objective, minimizing exposure to market volatility.",
