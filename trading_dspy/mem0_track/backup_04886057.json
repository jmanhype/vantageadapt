      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very high overall win rate, which seems unusually high and might indicate a data error or an extremely high-performing period that may not be sustainable. Therefore, the strategy will focus on capital preservation and risk management while trying to capture consistent, small gains.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the potential for sudden changes in market conditions, a mean reversion strategy might be too risky without clear indicators of market regime. Instead, the strategy will focus on liquidity provision in the form of a market-making strategy, which can profit from bid-ask spreads and is less dependent on market direction. This approach requires careful management of inventory and risk, as well as the ability to quickly adjust to changing market conditions.",
