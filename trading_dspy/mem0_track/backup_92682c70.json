      "reasoning": "Given the market context with an unknown regime and a confidence level of 0.0, it's challenging to deduce a clear market direction or volatility level. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that the market might be experiencing irregular movements or that the strategies employed previously were high risk/high reward. In such uncertain conditions, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management is advisable. The strategy will focus on small, consistent gains rather than large bets, employing tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to protect against volatility and sudden market movements. The strategy will be dynamic, adjusting position sizes based on the perceived risk level of each trade, and will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points. Given the lack of clear market direction, the strategy will be prepared to take both long and short positions, aiming to capitalize on whatever movements the market presents.",
