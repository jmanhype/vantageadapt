    "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and the close proximity of the SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price indicates that the market is not trending. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be appropriate, aiming to buy near the lower range of the price and sell near the upper range. The balanced buy/sell ratio implies that there is no strong market sentiment bias, which further supports a non-directional, range-bound strategy. The strategy should include tight stop losses due to the potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes, as indicated by the moderate risk level. Position size should be conservative to manage risk effectively in this environment.",
