    "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and the close proximity of the SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price indicates that the market is not trending. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be appropriate, aiming to buy near the lower range of the price and sell near the upper range. The strategy should employ tight stop losses due to the potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes, as indicated by the market analysis. Position sizing should be conservative to manage risk effectively, especially since the market's risk level is unknown. The strategy will use RSI and moving averages as primary indicators to identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range for entry and exit points.",
