      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective. Instead, a mean reversion strategy could be more suitable, aiming to buy near the lower range and sell near the upper range of the current market price. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, supports the idea of a market that is neither overbought nor oversold, making it ripe for trades that capitalize on small, predictable price movements back towards the mean.\n\nGiven the balanced market sentiment and the moderate risk of sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes, it's crucial to implement tight risk management measures. This includes setting conservative stop loss and take profit levels to protect against unexpected market movements.",
