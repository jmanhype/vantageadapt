  "reasoning": "Given the current market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy focuses on taking advantage of small price fluctuations. The analysis indicates that the market lacks strong directional movement, which suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective. Instead, a mean-reversion approach is more suitable, where trades are initiated when the price deviates from the moving average (SMA20) and when the RSI indicates potential reversals. The entry conditions are set to trigger when the price is below the SMA20 by a small margin and the RSI is below 30, indicating potential oversold conditions. The exit conditions are designed to capture small gains when the price exceeds the SMA20 by a slight margin or when the RSI indicates overbought conditions. The stop loss is set at a moderate level to manage risk, while the take profit is set to capture small gains, reflecting the low volatility environment.",
