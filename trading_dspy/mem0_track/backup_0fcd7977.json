      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PNL and a high overall win rate, suggesting that previous strategies have been successful to some extent. However, the lack of specific market regime information necessitates a flexible strategy that can adapt to various market conditions. Therefore, the strategy will employ a cautious approach, using a low position size to minimize exposure and tight stop loss levels to protect against unforeseen market movements. The strategy will not rely heavily on directional trades given the uncertainty in the market regime, hence the HOLD signal. Instead, it will focus on identifying high-probability setups based on technical analysis and predefined entry and exit conditions. The strategy will incorporate a mix of technical indicators that are known for their effectiveness across different market conditions, such as moving averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold signals.",
