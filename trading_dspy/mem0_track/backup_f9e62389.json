      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and PNL, indicating some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. However, the overall win rate is low, suggesting a high variance in outcomes. This implies that while some trades are highly profitable, many are not, which could be indicative of a market that rewards specific, well-timed strategies or suffers from significant noise.\n\nIn such uncertain conditions, a strategy that focuses on risk management and capital preservation is paramount. The strategy should aim for a balanced approach, not leaning too heavily on either buying or selling without clear signals. Given the lack of clear market direction, a HOLD signal is appropriate until more definitive market conditions emerge.\n\nThe strategy will employ a moderate position size to manage risk while still allowing for meaningful participation in the market. Tight stop losses are necessary to protect against sudden adverse market movements, and conservative take profit levels should be set to ensure profits are captured during short-term movements, reflecting the high variance environment.",
