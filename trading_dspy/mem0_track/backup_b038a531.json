      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown and there's a lack of confidence in the current market analysis, a conservative approach to trading is advisable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade, but the overall win rate is low, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a strategy that focuses on high-quality trades with a strong risk-reward ratio to capitalize on the potential for significant gains while managing the risk of losses. A cautious position size and tight risk management parameters are recommended to navigate the uncertain market conditions effectively.",
