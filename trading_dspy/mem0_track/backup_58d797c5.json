      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that a few trades have generated significant returns while the majority may not have been successful. This scenario calls for a strategy that can minimize losses while still capturing potential high-return trades. A balanced approach that combines trend-following for potential high-return trades with mean-reversion for more frequent, smaller gains could be appropriate. The strategy will use technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points, focusing on high-probability setups and employing strict risk management to cut losses quickly.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the mixed performance data, the trade signal is to HOLD until clearer signals emerge from the market analysis. The strategy will be ready to execute BUY or SELL orders based on the specified entry conditions, focusing on capital preservation until more definitive market trends are identified.",
