      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PNL and a high overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. However, without specific details on the market conditions that led to this performance, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management. A mean reversion strategy might be too risky without clear indications of the market regime. Instead, a more flexible approach that can adapt to both trending and ranging markets is advisable. This could involve using indicators that can provide signals in various market conditions, such as moving averages for trend following and RSI for identifying overbought or oversold conditions. The strategy should employ tight stop losses to protect against sudden market moves and modest take profit levels to ensure gains are captured in uncertain market conditions.",
