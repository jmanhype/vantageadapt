      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, which indicates that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are rare. This scenario calls for a strategy that minimizes risk while trying to capture potential upside in a highly uncertain market.\n\nConsidering these conditions, the strategy will focus on capital preservation and risk management, employing tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to ensure that any losses are kept small and profits are taken systematically. The strategy will use a HOLD signal as a base, indicating no strong bias towards buying or selling in the current unknown regime. The strategy will be designed to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, ready to switch to BUY or SELL signals if clear trends emerge.\n\nGiven the lack of specific market direction and the high level of uncertainty, the strategy will employ a low position size to minimize exposure. The stop loss and take profit levels will be set conservatively to manage risk effectively. Entry and exit conditions will be based on a combination of technical indicators that are known for their reliability in various market conditions, such as moving averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold signals, to provide additional layers of decision-making criteria.",
