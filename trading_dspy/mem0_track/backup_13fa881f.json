      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PnL per trade and an overall win rate, suggesting that certain strategies have been effective in the recent market conditions. However, the low overall win rate implies a need for cautious risk management. The strategy will focus on capital preservation and risk management, aiming to capture small, consistent gains rather than seeking large profits, which aligns with the positive but modest average PnL.\n\nGiven the lack of specific market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal as a base stance, waiting for clearer signals before executing trades. The strategy will be designed to quickly adapt to market changes, employing tight stop losses to protect against sudden adverse movements and modest take profits to ensure gains are captured in uncertain market conditions.",
