  "reasoning": "Given the current market context, we are in a bullish trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows, strong buying momentum indicated by an RSI above 60, and increasing volume on upward movements. The 20-period moving average being above the 50-period moving average further confirms the bullish sentiment. However, there is a moderate risk due to potential volatility spikes. Therefore, the strategy will focus on entering long positions while implementing risk management through stop-loss and take-profit levels. The entry conditions will be based on the confirmation of bullish signals, while exit conditions will be set to secure profits and limit losses.",
