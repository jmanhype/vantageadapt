      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PNL and a relatively high overall win rate, indicating that some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. However, the lack of clarity on the market regime means that these conditions could change rapidly, and strategies that were previously successful may not continue to perform well. Therefore, the strategy will focus on short-term, low-risk trades with tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to capture small movements in the market. The strategy will employ a HOLD signal initially until specific entry conditions are met, emphasizing the need for caution in an uncertain market environment. The strategy will use technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points, focusing on overbought and oversold conditions as indicated by oscillators like RSI, combined with price action near key support and resistance levels.",
