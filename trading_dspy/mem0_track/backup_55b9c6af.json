      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that a mean-reversion strategy could be effective. In such a market, prices tend to oscillate between support and resistance levels without making significant breakouts. The strategy will use technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range, suggesting potential reversal points. The proximity of the Simple Moving Averages (SMA_20 and SMA_50) to each other and the current price further supports the choice of a mean-reversion strategy, as it indicates that prices are not trending strongly in either direction. The strategy will aim to buy at or near perceived support levels when the market is oversold and sell at or near resistance levels when the market is overbought. The balanced buy/sell ratio and absence of significant volume spikes reinforce the decision to focus on small, consistent gains rather than large directional bets. Risk management will be crucial, given the moderate risk of sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes, as highlighted in the market analysis.",
