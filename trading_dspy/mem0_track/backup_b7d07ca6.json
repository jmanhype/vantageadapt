      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and the close proximity of the moving averages (SMA_20 and SMA_50) to the current price indicates that the market is not trending. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be appropriate, aiming to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end. The balanced buy/sell ratio suggests that there is no strong market bias, which further supports a non-directional, range-bound strategy. The strategy will use technical indicators such as RSI to identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range, and moving averages to confirm the market is still in a ranging condition. The low volatility environment suggests that tight stop losses and take profit levels can be used to manage risk while aiming for smaller, more frequent gains.",
