      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are rare. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic opportunities for gains amidst generally uncertain conditions. Therefore, the strategy will focus on identifying high-probability setups, using stringent criteria for trade entries and exits to minimize risk. The strategy will employ technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points, focusing on overbought and oversold conditions, trend reversals, and price action patterns that have historically indicated profitable trading opportunities.",
