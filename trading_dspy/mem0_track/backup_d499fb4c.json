      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. The risk level is also unknown, which adds to the difficulty in formulating a precise strategy. However, the recent performance data indicates a relatively high average return and a positive average PnL, suggesting that some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. The overall win rate, although seemingly presented as a percentage, appears to be misinterpreted and should be considered cautiously. In such uncertain market conditions, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation is advisable. The strategy should aim for small, consistent gains rather than large bets, with tight risk management controls to protect against unforeseen market movements.",
