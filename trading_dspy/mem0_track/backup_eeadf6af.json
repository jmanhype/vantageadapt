      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a high overall win rate and a positive average PnL, indicating that the market has been favorable to traders over the lookback period. In such uncertain conditions, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management is advisable. The strategy will aim to capitalize on small, consistent gains rather than seeking large wins, which aligns with the recent performance showing a decent average return per trade. Without specific market trends or volatility information, the strategy will rely on basic technical analysis indicators for entry and exit signals, ensuring flexibility across various market conditions.",
