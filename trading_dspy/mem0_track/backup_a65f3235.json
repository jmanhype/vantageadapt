      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. In such a scenario, a cautious approach is warranted. The recent performance data indicates a positive average return and P&L, suggesting that some strategies have been successful in the current market environment. However, the overall win rate is low, indicating a high level of risk and potential for loss. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, aiming to secure small, consistent gains rather than seeking large profits. A HOLD signal is appropriate until more definitive market trends emerge. The strategy will employ tight stop losses to protect against sudden market movements and moderate position sizes to manage exposure. Entry and exit conditions will be based on technical indicators that can identify potential short-term opportunities in a highly uncertain market.",
