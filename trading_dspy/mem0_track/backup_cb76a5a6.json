      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown and there's a low confidence in the current market analysis, a conservative approach to trading is recommended. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade, but the overall win rate is confusingly presented as over 100%, which seems to be an error. Assuming a more realistic win rate would be below 100%, the strategy should focus on preserving capital and managing risk effectively. A strategy that can adapt to various market conditions without relying heavily on a specific market regime would be ideal. Therefore, a flexible mean reversion strategy that can be adjusted based on market performance feedback might be suitable. This strategy would involve buying on weakness in a downtrend and selling on strength in an uptrend, with tight control over risk parameters. The strategy will use technical indicators such as RSI for identifying overbought and oversold conditions, and moving averages to gauge the market trend direction. The lack of clear market regime suggests a need for a dynamic approach, adjusting position size, stop loss, and take profit levels based on ongoing market performance and volatility.",
