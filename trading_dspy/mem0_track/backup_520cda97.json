      "reasoning": "Given the market context lacks specific regime identification, confidence level, and risk level, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should be flexible, focusing on capital preservation and risk management while still allowing for profit in uncertain market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and win rate, indicating that a strategy with moderate risk and reward parameters could capitalize on current market dynamics. The lack of specific market regime information necessitates a strategy that can adapt to both trending and range-bound markets. Therefore, the strategy will incorporate both trend-following and mean-reversion elements, with a focus on short to medium-term trades.",
