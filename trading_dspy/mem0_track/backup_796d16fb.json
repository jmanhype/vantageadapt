  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA20 and SMA50 to the current price, along with RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, suggests that the market lacks a strong directional trend. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective, aiming to buy near the lower end of the range and sell near the upper end. The strategy will use tight stop losses and take profit levels to manage risk and capture gains in this low volatility environment. The previous successful parameters indicate a preference for trading based on SMA and RSI indicators, which aligns well with a ranging market strategy. Adjustments to position size, stop loss, and take profit levels will be made to optimize the strategy for current market conditions, focusing on risk management and capital preservation.",
