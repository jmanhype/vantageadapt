      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data indicates a high overall win rate and a positive average PNL, suggesting that the market has been favorable to the analyzed strategies over the last 7 days. However, without a clear understanding of the current market regime and risk level, the strategy should prioritize capital preservation and risk management.\n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal as a base stance until more definitive market conditions can be identified. The strategy will focus on small, calculated positions to capitalize on clear opportunities identified through technical analysis, without assuming significant market directionality.\n\nThe strategy will employ a low position size to minimize exposure, a tight stop loss to protect against unexpected market movements, and a conservative take profit to ensure gains are captured without assuming large market swings. Entry and exit conditions will be based on technical indicators that are effective across various market conditions, such as moving averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold signals, allowing for flexibility in strategy execution.",
