      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PnL per trade, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. However, the overall win rate of 3.08% seems to be a misinterpretation (likely meant to be 30.8% if considering typical trading win rates), suggesting a need for cautious optimism. Given these conditions, a strategy that is not overly reliant on predicting market direction would be prudent. A mean reversion strategy could be suitable, as it does not require a strong trend and can capitalize on small price movements, aligning with the positive average PnL observed. The strategy will focus on identifying overbought and oversold conditions using technical indicators, entering trades when prices deviate significantly from a moving average and are expected to revert back.",
