      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown and there's a low confidence in the current market analysis, a conservative approach is warranted. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade, but without clear information on the win rate (the overall win rate of 3.08% seems to be incorrectly presented), it's difficult to gauge the success rate of the strategies analyzed. In such uncertain conditions, a strategy that minimizes risk while still allowing for potential gains is advisable. A mean reversion strategy could be suitable, as it does not rely on clear trend directions and can perform in various market conditions. This strategy would aim to capitalize on small, predictable price reversals from recent price extremes. Given the lack of clear market direction, maintaining a balanced position size and employing tight stop losses and modest take profits can help manage risk. The strategy will focus on technical indicators that identify overbought and oversold conditions as entry signals, ensuring trades are entered at points likely to precede a price reversal.",
