    "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and the close proximity of the SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price further supports a mean-reversion approach rather than trend-following. The balanced buy/sell ratio indicates that there isn't a clear market bias, which aligns with a strategy that doesn't rely on strong trends. Therefore, the strategy will focus on identifying overbought and oversold conditions within the range for entry points, using RSI as a primary indicator due to its effectiveness in ranging markets. The strategy will employ tight stop losses to protect against sudden volatility spikes and modest take profit levels to capture gains within the range. Position sizing will be conservative to manage risk effectively in this environment.",
