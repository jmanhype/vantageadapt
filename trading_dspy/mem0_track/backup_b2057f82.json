      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are rare. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic volatility spikes or unpredictable movements. Therefore, the strategy should aim to identify high-probability setups with clear risk-reward parameters. A cautious approach would involve smaller position sizes to manage risk effectively, tight stop losses to protect against sudden adverse movements, and conservative take profit levels to ensure profits are captured during uncertain market conditions. The strategy will focus on technical analysis, using indicators that can identify potential reversals or continuation patterns within the market noise.",
