    "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and instead, a mean reversion strategy could be more suitable. In a ranging market, prices tend to oscillate between support and resistance levels. Therefore, the strategy will aim to buy near support levels and sell near resistance levels, or vice versa for short positions, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to the mean. The strategy will use technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought and oversold conditions within this range, which can signal potential reversal points. Additionally, moving averages (SMA_20 and SMA_50) will be monitored to ensure trades are aligned with the short-term market sentiment. Given the low volatility, a conservative approach to position sizing, stop loss, and take profit levels is recommended to manage risk effectively.",
