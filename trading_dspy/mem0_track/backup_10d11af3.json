      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return and average PNL per trade, indicating that some strategies have been effective in this market. The overall win rate, though seemingly represented in an unusual percentage, suggests a positive outcome for a significant portion of trades. \n\nIn such uncertain conditions, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management is advisable. A strategy that can adapt to various market conditions, such as a mean reversion strategy with dynamic entry and exit conditions based on volatility, could be suitable. This approach allows for flexibility in an unknown regime, aiming to capitalize on small, consistent gains while minimizing losses.\n\nGiven the lack of specific market direction and the unknown risk level, maintaining a neutral stance with a HOLD signal until clearer market conditions emerge is prudent. The strategy should focus on small position sizes to manage risk, tight stop losses to protect capital, and modest take profit levels to ensure profitability on successful trades.",
