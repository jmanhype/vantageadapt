      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade, but the overall win rate is low, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic volatility spikes or trend reversals, making it challenging to predict movements based on recent history alone. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management while attempting to capture gains from potential market movements.\n\nGiven these conditions, a mean reversion strategy might be too risky without clear indications of the market regime. Instead, a more conservative approach that uses tight stop losses to protect capital and modest take profits to capture gains without expecting large movements would be advisable. The strategy should be ready to take a position (BUY or SELL) based on short-term market movements but must prioritize minimizing losses through effective risk management.",
