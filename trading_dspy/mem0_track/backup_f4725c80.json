      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade, but the overall win rate is confusingly presented as over 3%, which seems like a misinterpretation (likely meant to be 31.13% if considering standard win rate presentation). This indicates that while profitable trades have been made, the strategy's consistency and reliability may be in question. Therefore, the strategy developed will focus on capital preservation, low risk, and adaptability to different market conditions.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the trade signal will be HOLD until clearer market conditions emerge. This conservative approach prioritizes risk management and capital preservation in uncertain market conditions.",
