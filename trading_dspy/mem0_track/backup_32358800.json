      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the current market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. In such a scenario, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, given the lack of clear direction in the market. The recent performance data indicates a relatively high average return and win rate, suggesting that previous strategies have been successful, but without a clear understanding of the current market regime, these past performances may not be indicative of future results.\n\nIn light of this, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal as the primary trade signal, indicating no new positions should be initiated until more information about the market regime becomes available or until a clearer trend emerges. The strategy parameters will be set conservatively to minimize risk in case market conditions change suddenly.",
