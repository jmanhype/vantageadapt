      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade and an overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. However, without a clear understanding of the market regime and risk level, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management.\n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy will employ a cautious approach, focusing on small, consistent gains rather than aggressive trades. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators that are known for their effectiveness across various market conditions, such as Moving Averages for trend identification and RSI (Relative Strength Index) for identifying overbought or oversold conditions. The strategy will aim for a balanced risk-reward ratio, employing tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to protect against unknown market movements.",
