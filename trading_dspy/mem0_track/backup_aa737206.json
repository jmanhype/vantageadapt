  "reasoning": "Given the current market context of \"RANGING_LOW_VOL,\" characterized by narrow price movements, low volatility, and a neutral RSI, a conservative trading strategy is warranted. In such environments, it's typical for traders to look for breakout opportunities or range-bound strategies. However, with recent performance indicating significant losses and low win rates, the approach must prioritize risk management and smaller position sizes to navigate potential unexpected volatility shifts. The strategy will utilize small position sizing, tight stop losses, and reasonable take profits to adapt to the current market dynamics.",
