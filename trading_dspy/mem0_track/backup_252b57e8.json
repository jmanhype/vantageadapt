      "reasoning": "Given the market context lacks specific regime identification, confidence level, and risk level, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should be flexible, focusing on capital preservation and risk management, while still allowing for profit in uncertain market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and win rate, indicating some strategies have been effective in the current environment. Therefore, the strategy will aim to capitalize on short-term movements with tight risk controls.",
