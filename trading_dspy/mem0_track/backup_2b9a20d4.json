      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that a mean reversion strategy could be effective. In such a market, prices tend to oscillate around a mean value, allowing traders to buy low and sell high within the range. The close proximity of the SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, reinforces the potential for a mean reversion approach. The strategy will use technical indicators to identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range for entry points, and set conservative stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk. The low volatility suggests that price movements are unlikely to be extreme, allowing for tighter control of risk parameters.",
