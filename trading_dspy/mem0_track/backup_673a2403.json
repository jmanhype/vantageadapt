      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and the low volatility indicates that price movements are likely to be smaller and less erratic. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be suitable, aiming to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end. The strategy will use technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger Bands to identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range. The RSI will help in identifying potential reversal points by highlighting overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) conditions, while Bollinger Bands will provide visual cues on the current price position within the volatility range. The strategy will maintain a conservative approach to position sizing and risk management due to the moderate risk of sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes as indicated in the market analysis.",
