      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade and an overall win rate, indicating that some strategies have been effective in the recent past. Without specific market direction or volatility information, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management is advisable.\n\nA strategy that can adapt to various market conditions without relying heavily on predicting market direction would be most prudent. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy that trades on the assumption that prices will revert to their mean over time might be suitable. This strategy can be effective in both trending and range-bound markets if properly managed. The strategy will focus on identifying overbought and oversold conditions using technical indicators as entry signals, with tight stop losses to manage risk and modest take profit levels to ensure profitability on trades.",
