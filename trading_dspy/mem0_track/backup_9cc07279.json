  "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with the RSI fluctuating around the mid-range, suggests that the market lacks a strong directional trend. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective in this environment. This strategy will aim to buy at low points within the range and sell at high points, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to its average price level after minor deviations.\n\nThe strategy will use tighter stop loss and take profit levels than those in the base parameters to manage risk effectively in a low volatility environment. The position size will be adjusted to manage exposure, considering the moderate risk of sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes as indicated by the market analysis.\n\nGiven the ranging market, the trade signal will be set to HOLD until specific entry conditions are met, indicating a potential mean reversion opportunity. This cautious approach aligns with the need to manage risk effectively in the current market conditions.",
