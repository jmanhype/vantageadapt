      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a low overall win rate, indicating that a few trades have generated significant returns while the majority may not have been successful. This scenario calls for a strategy that emphasizes risk management and aims to improve the win rate while still capturing significant moves when they occur. A balanced approach that combines trend-following and mean-reversion elements could be suitable, allowing the strategy to adapt to changing market conditions. The strategy will use technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, with a focus on minimizing losses through tight stop losses and taking profits at reasonable levels to ensure gains are captured efficiently.",
