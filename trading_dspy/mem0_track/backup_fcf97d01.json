      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while some trades are highly profitable, the majority are not. This scenario suggests a market that may offer opportunities for significant gains but at a high risk of loss. Therefore, the strategy should aim to identify high-probability setups with clear risk-reward parameters.\n\nConsidering the lack of clear market direction and the high variance in trade outcomes, the strategy will adopt a cautious approach, using a HOLD signal as the default stance until more definitive market conditions emerge. The strategy will focus on small position sizes to manage exposure, tight stop losses to protect against sudden adverse movements, and conservative take profit levels to ensure gains are captured without assuming excessive risk.",
