  "reasoning": "Given the current market context, we are in a bearish trend characterized by lower highs and lower lows, with significant selling pressure indicated by the RSI being below 30. The market's bearish momentum is reinforced by volume spikes during down moves and the alignment of moving averages. Therefore, the strategy will focus on short-selling opportunities, capitalizing on the downward price movement while managing risk effectively.\n\nThe trade signal is to SELL, as the market conditions favor bearish positions. The parameters will be set to ensure that we have a defined risk management strategy, with a stop loss to limit potential losses and a take profit to secure gains when the market moves favorably.",
