      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PnL and an overall win rate, suggesting that some strategies have been effective in the current market conditions. However, the lack of specific regime information and low confidence in the current analysis necessitates a strategy that can perform well across various market conditions. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy that aims to capitalize on small, frequent price movements might be suitable, as it does not rely heavily on the direction of the market. This strategy will focus on identifying overbought and oversold conditions using technical indicators like RSI and moving averages to determine entry and exit points. The strategy will employ tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to manage risk effectively, considering the unknown risk level. The position size will be conservative to manage the unknown risk, and the strategy will include conditions for both entry and exit to ensure trades are executed based on clear signals.",
