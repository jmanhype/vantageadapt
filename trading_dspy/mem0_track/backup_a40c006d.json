  "reasoning": "Given the current market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy will focus on capturing small price movements within the established range. The lack of strong directional movement and the close proximity of the moving averages suggest that significant price changes are unlikely in the short term. Therefore, a conservative approach is warranted, utilizing a small position size and tight stop-loss to manage risk effectively. The strategy will employ a mean-reversion approach, entering long positions when the price is near the lower bound of the range and exiting when it approaches the upper bound. This aligns with the current market conditions and aims to exploit the low volatility environment.",
