    "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective. Instead, a mean reversion strategy could be more suitable, aiming to buy near the lower range and sell near the upper range of the current market price. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, supports the idea of a market that is neither overbought nor oversold, making it ripe for trades that capitalize on small, predictable price movements. The strategy will use these indicators to identify potential entry and exit points within the range. Given the low volatility, a conservative approach to position sizing and risk management is advisable to protect against sudden market moves.",
