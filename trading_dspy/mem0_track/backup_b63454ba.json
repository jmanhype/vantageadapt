    "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective. Instead, a mean reversion strategy could be more suitable, aiming to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end. The close proximity of the SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, supports this approach. The strategy will use these indicators to identify potential entry and exit points within the range. The balanced buy/sell ratio indicates that there is no clear dominance of buying or selling pressure, which further supports a strategy that does not rely on strong trends. Given the moderate risk of sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes, the strategy will incorporate tight stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively.",
