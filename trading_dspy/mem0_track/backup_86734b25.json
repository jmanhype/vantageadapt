      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to the current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade and an overall win rate of 3.08%, which indicates some strategies have been successful in the current environment. Without specific details on market direction or volatility, a conservative approach focusing on risk management is advisable. The strategy will aim to capitalize on small, consistent gains rather than large bets, given the lack of clear market direction. This approach aligns with the successful average return and PnL data, suggesting that moderate, steady strategies have been effective.",
