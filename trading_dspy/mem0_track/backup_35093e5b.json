      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data indicates a high overall win rate and a positive average PNL, suggesting that the market has been favorable to the analyzed strategies over the last 7 days. However, without a clear understanding of the current market regime and risk level, the strategy should prioritize capital preservation and risk management.\n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal as a base stance until more definitive market conditions can be identified. The strategy will focus on maintaining a low position size to minimize exposure, employing tight stop loss levels to protect against unexpected market movements, and setting conservative take profit levels to ensure gains are captured during periods of market clarity.\n\nThe strategy will be designed to quickly adapt to new market information as it becomes available, with a focus on monitoring key indicators that could signal a change in market conditions or risk levels. This approach allows for capital preservation in uncertain market conditions while positioning for potential engagement when the market regime becomes clearer.",
