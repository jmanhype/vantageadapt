      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the current market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. In such a scenario, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, given the lack of clear market direction. The recent performance data indicates a high overall win rate and a positive average PnL, suggesting that strategies employed in the past week have been effective. However, without a clear understanding of the market regime, it's prudent to adopt a HOLD position until more definitive market signals emerge.\n\nIn this context, the strategy will not actively seek to enter new trades but will instead focus on managing any existing positions with strict risk management protocols. The strategy parameters will be set conservatively to reflect the high level of uncertainty and to prioritize the protection of capital.",
