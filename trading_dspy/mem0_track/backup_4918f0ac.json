      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PNL and a win rate, indicating some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. However, the low overall win rate suggests a cautious approach is warranted. The strategy will therefore aim to capitalize on small, consistent gains while employing tight risk management to protect against unknown market conditions. A mean reversion strategy might be too risky without clear market direction, so the strategy will focus on high-probability setups identified through technical analysis, with a preference for liquidity and smaller position sizes to ensure flexibility.",
