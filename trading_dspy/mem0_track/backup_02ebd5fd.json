  "reasoning": "Given the lack of specific market regime information and the general theme, the strategy will be designed to be adaptable, focusing on capturing short to medium-term trends while managing risk effectively. The recent performance data suggests a positive trend in trading outcomes, with a significant average profit per trade and a high overall win rate. This indicates that the market may be in a state where momentum or trend-following strategies could perform well. However, without a clear indication of the market regime (bullish, bearish, or sideways), the strategy will incorporate a mix of indicators that can adapt to changing market conditions. The strategy will aim to capitalize on clear trends when they are present and reduce exposure in uncertain conditions.",
