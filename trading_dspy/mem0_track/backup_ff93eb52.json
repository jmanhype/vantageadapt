      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade, but without clear information on the market regime, it's challenging to predict future movements accurately. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management while attempting to capture gains in uncertain market conditions. A flexible approach, using a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, could be beneficial. The strategy will employ a tight stop loss to protect against sudden market movements and a modest take profit to secure gains. Position sizing will be conservative to manage risk effectively. The strategy will be designed to adapt to changing market conditions, with the ability to hold positions in the absence of clear trading signals.",
