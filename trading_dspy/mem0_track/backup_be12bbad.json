      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade, but the overall win rate is low, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic volatility spikes or trend reversals, making it challenging to predict. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management while trying to capture gains from potential market movements.\n\nA balanced approach that combines trend-following and mean-reversion elements could be effective. This hybrid strategy can adapt to changing market conditions, aiming to capture profits from both trending and ranging markets. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, including moving averages for trend detection and RSI for identifying overbought or oversold conditions.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the market regime, a HOLD signal is appropriate until clear market conditions are identified. The strategy parameters are set conservatively to manage risk effectively.",
