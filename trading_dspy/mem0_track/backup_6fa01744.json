      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PnL, indicating some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. However, the overall win rate is low, suggesting a high level of volatility or unpredictability in trade outcomes. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, employing a cautious approach to position sizing and stop-loss levels. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, aiming to capitalize on small, consistent gains rather than large, risky moves. Given the lack of clear market direction, the strategy will be designed to work in both bullish and bearish conditions, making it versatile and responsive to market changes.",
