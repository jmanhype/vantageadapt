      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective, and the close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price indicates that the market is not trending. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be appropriate, aiming to buy near the lower range of the price and sell near the upper range. The strategy should employ tight stop losses due to the low volatility, minimizing the risk of significant losses if the market moves against the position. A moderate take profit level should be set to capture profits from small price movements. The strategy should use a smaller position size to manage risk effectively, considering the potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes as indicated by the market analysis.",
