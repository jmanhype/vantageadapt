      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. In such a scenario, a cautious approach is warranted. The strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, given the lack of clear market direction. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PnL, suggesting that some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. However, the overall win rate is low, indicating a high level of risk. Therefore, the strategy will aim to make small, calculated trades based on short-term price movements, employing tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to manage risk effectively. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, focusing on short-term volatility and price levels rather than long-term trends.",
