      "reasoning": "Given the market context lacks specific regime identification, confidence level, and risk level, a conservative approach to trading strategy development is warranted. The strategy should be adaptable, focusing on capital preservation and risk management, while still allowing for profit in uncertain market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and PNL, indicating some strategies have been effective in the current market. However, the overall win rate is unusually reported (likely an error in interpretation), suggesting caution. The strategy will aim to capitalize on short-term movements, given the lack of clear long-term market direction, using technical analysis to identify entry and exit points.",
