  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, suggests that the market lacks a clear direction. Therefore, a strategy that does not rely on strong trends but rather on the identification of support and resistance levels within the range would be appropriate. The strategy should employ tight stop losses to minimize risk due to the potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes. A conservative position size is recommended to manage risk effectively in this uncertain environment. The use of SMA indicators for entry and exit signals is suitable for identifying potential reversals within the range. However, adjustments to the parameters of the base strategy, particularly reducing the MACD signal periods to make the strategy more responsive to the current market conditions, are necessary.",
