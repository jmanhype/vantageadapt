      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade and an overall win rate of approximately 3%, which, although it seems to be a misinterpretation (likely meant to be 30.47% if considering typical win rate formats), indicates some level of success in recent trading activities. Based on this, a conservative approach that aims to preserve capital while still capturing potential gains seems prudent. Without specific market direction or volatility information, a strategy that can adapt to various conditions is necessary. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy that looks for price extremes to enter trades, combined with tight risk management, could be effective. This approach is generally less dependent on market regime and can perform in both volatile and stable markets.",
