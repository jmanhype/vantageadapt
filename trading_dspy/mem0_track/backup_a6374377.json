  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The analysis indicates that the price movements are contained within a narrow range, and the RSI values fluctuate around the mid-range, suggesting no strong momentum in either direction. This environment is conducive to a mean-reversion strategy, where trades are entered when the price deviates from its average, expecting it to revert back. The close alignment of SMA_20 and SMA_50 supports the use of these indicators for identifying entry and exit points. Since the market is not showing signs of strong momentum, a cautious approach with tight stop loss and take profit levels is advisable to manage risk effectively. The strategy will use SMA20 as a baseline for identifying overbought and oversold conditions, combined with RSI14 to confirm the lack of momentum before entering trades. The overall win rate from the recent performance suggests that a strategy focusing on short-term movements with moderate risk management can be successful in the current market conditions.",
