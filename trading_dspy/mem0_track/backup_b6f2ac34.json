      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic opportunities for substantial gains but is also fraught with risks of losses. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation while being opportunistic in capturing gains.\n\nA cautious approach would involve a low position size to minimize exposure, tight stop losses to protect against sudden adverse market movements, and modest take profit levels to ensure profits are captured without expecting large movements. The strategy should be flexible, employing both technical and fundamental analysis to identify entry and exit points, and should not rely heavily on any single market condition given the unknown regime.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the trade signal is to HOLD until clearer signals emerge from the market analysis. The strategy should prioritize risk management, waiting for high-confidence setups before executing trades.",
