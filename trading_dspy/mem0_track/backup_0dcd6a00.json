      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data indicates a relatively high average PnL per trade and an overall win rate, suggesting that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. However, the lack of specific market regime information requires a strategy that can perform well in both trending and ranging markets. Therefore, the strategy will focus on risk management, using tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to protect gains and limit losses. The strategy will employ a combination of technical indicators that are effective in various market conditions, such as moving averages for trend following and RSI for identifying overbought or oversold conditions, to determine entry and exit points. The strategy will also use position sizing as a key risk management tool, opting for a conservative position size given the uncertainty in market conditions.",
