      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that the market might be experiencing significant fluctuations or that the strategies employed previously were high risk/high reward. In such uncertain conditions, a strategy focusing on capital preservation and risk management becomes paramount.\n\nA mean reversion strategy might be too risky without clear indications of the market regime. Instead, a more conservative approach focusing on liquidity and volatility management could be more appropriate. This strategy would involve shorter-term trades, possibly intraday, to avoid exposure to overnight market moves which can be unpredictable in an unknown regime. The strategy would use a combination of volatility indicators and liquidity measures to identify trading opportunities where the risk/reward ratio is favorable.",
