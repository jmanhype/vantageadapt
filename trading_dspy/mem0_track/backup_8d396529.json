      "reasoning": "Given the market context lacks specific regime identification, confidence in the current market conditions is at 0.0, and the risk level is unknown, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should focus on capital preservation while still allowing for potential profit in uncertain market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a positive average return and PnL, indicating some strategies have been successful in the current environment. However, the overall win rate is low, emphasizing the need for tight risk management.\n\nA neutral trade signal (HOLD) is recommended until clearer market conditions emerge. However, for the purpose of strategy development, we will prepare for both potential uptrends and downtrends, focusing on quick reactions to market movements.\n\nThe strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, emphasizing short-term momentum and reversals. Given the unknown market regime, the strategy will employ a smaller position size to mitigate risk, a tight stop loss to protect capital, and a moderate take-profit level to ensure profits are captured without expecting large market moves.",
