      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. In such a scenario, a cautious approach is warranted. The strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, given the lack of clear market direction. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PnL and a win rate, suggesting that some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. However, the overall win rate is unusually low, which might be a data interpretation error, as win rates are typically expressed as percentages rather than multiples of 100. \n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal for now, indicating no new positions should be opened until more definitive market trends emerge. The strategy parameters will be set conservatively to minimize risk in case market conditions change and trading opportunities become clearer.",
