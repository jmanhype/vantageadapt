  "reasoning": "Based on the market analysis provided, the market is currently in a ranging low volatility regime. The lack of strong directional movement, RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, close proximity of moving averages (SMA_20 and SMA_50) to the current price, and balanced buy/sell ratio all indicate a market with low volatility and no clear trend. In such conditions, it is prudent to adopt a mean reversion strategy that takes advantage of price fluctuations within the range.",
