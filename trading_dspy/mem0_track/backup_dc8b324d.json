    "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, suggests that the market lacks a clear direction. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective in this environment. This strategy will aim to buy at low points within the range and sell at high points, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to its average price level.\n\nThe strategy will use a combination of SMA and RSI indicators to identify potential entry and exit points. The SMA will help determine the market's average price level, while the RSI will be used to identify overbought and oversold conditions, which are indicative of potential reversals within the range.\n\nGiven the low volatility, a tighter stop loss can be used to minimize risk, while a moderate take profit level can help lock in gains before the market potentially reverses direction. The position size will be adjusted to manage risk effectively, considering the market's moderate risk level due to potential sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes.",
