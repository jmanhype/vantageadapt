  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close alignment of SMA20 and SMA50 supports the use of these indicators for identifying entry and exit points within the range. Since the RSI is fluctuating around the mid-range, it suggests that the market is neither overbought nor oversold, making it less likely for a breakout to occur soon. Therefore, the strategy should be conservative, aiming for smaller, consistent gains rather than large moves. The previous parameters indicate a preference for SMA and MACD indicators, but given the low volatility, adjustments are needed to better capture the current market dynamics. The strategy will focus on tighter stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively in a low volatility environment. The trade signal will be based on technical indicators that are well-suited for ranging markets, such as the SMA crossover for entry and exit points, and the MACD to confirm the strength and direction of the trend within the range.",
