      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown and there's a low confidence in the current market analysis, a conservative approach to trading strategy development is warranted. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade, but without clear insights into the market's direction or volatility, a flexible strategy that can adapt to both trending and ranging conditions is advisable. The strategy should focus on risk management, employing tight stop losses and moderate take profit levels to protect gains and limit losses. The overall win rate, although presented in an unclear format, hints at the potential effectiveness of previous strategies, suggesting that a data-driven approach to identifying entry and exit conditions could be beneficial. Given the lack of specific market conditions, the strategy will rely on technical analysis indicators that are effective in various market regimes, such as moving averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold conditions.",
