      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that a mean-reversion strategy could be effective. In such a market, prices tend to oscillate between support and resistance levels without making significant breakouts. The strategy will aim to buy near support levels and sell near resistance levels, or vice versa for short positions, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to its average. The close proximity of the SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price further supports the idea that the market is balanced and might continue to range. The strategy will use these moving averages as dynamic support and resistance levels to identify potential entry and exit points. Given the low volatility, a tighter stop loss and a modest take profit level are appropriate to manage risk while aiming for realistic gains within the range. The balanced buy/sell ratio indicates that there is no strong market sentiment, reinforcing the decision for a non-directional, mean-reversion approach.",
