      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade and an overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. However, the lack of specific market regime information necessitates a strategy that can perform well under various conditions. Therefore, a balanced approach that incorporates both trend-following and mean-reversion components could be beneficial. This dual approach allows for capitalizing on market movements regardless of the direction while managing risk effectively. The strategy will use technical indicators that can adapt to changing market conditions, such as moving averages for trend detection and RSI for identifying overbought or oversold conditions. The strategy will maintain a moderate position size to manage risk, employ tight stop losses to protect against large losses, and set realistic take profit levels to ensure profitability.",
