      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PnL per trade, which indicates that there have been profitable opportunities in the market. However, the overall win rate being over 3% seems to be a typographical error or misinterpretation, as win rates are typically expressed as a percentage of total trades and should be between 0 and 100%. Assuming a reasonable win rate, the strategy should focus on preserving capital while seeking out low-risk opportunities to maintain or improve upon the average PnL.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and risk level, the strategy will adopt a cautious approach, focusing on short-term, low-risk trades. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, with a focus on minimizing losses and locking in profits quickly.",
