      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or volatility pattern to base a strategy on. The risk level is also unknown, which adds to the challenge of defining a specific strategy. However, the recent performance data indicates a positive average return and PNL, suggesting that some strategies have been successful under these conditions. Given these factors, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management is advisable. The strategy should be flexible, employing both trend-following and mean-reversion components to adapt to changing market conditions. The use of a dynamic position sizing method based on recent performance metrics and a tight stop loss will be crucial to manage the unknown risk. The strategy will aim for small, consistent gains rather than large bets, given the overall uncertainty.",
