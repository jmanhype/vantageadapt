      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are rare. This scenario calls for a strategy that minimizes risk while seeking to capture opportunities that present a high reward-to-risk ratio.\n\nConsidering the lack of specific market direction and the need to manage risk effectively, the strategy will focus on identifying high-probability setups with clear risk-reward parameters. The strategy will employ a combination of technical analysis for entry and exit signals, along with strict risk management rules to protect capital.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the market context, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal as a base stance, moving to BUY or SELL only when very clear signals are present. This cautious approach aims to preserve capital while still participating in potential opportunities that align with the strategy's risk-reward criteria.",
