      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until more definitive market conditions can be identified. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating a potentially high-risk environment where a few trades have resulted in significant gains. This scenario calls for a strategy that minimizes risk while waiting for clearer market signals.\n\nGiven these conditions, a HOLD signal is most prudent at this time. The strategy should not initiate new positions until a clearer market direction is established. However, for the sake of completeness in strategy development, should the market conditions become more favorable and identifiable, the following parameters are proposed:\n\n1. **Position Size**: Small, to limit exposure.\n2. **Stop Loss**: Tight, to minimize potential losses on any trade.\n3. **Take Profit**: Conservative, to ensure profits are captured without assuming excessive risk.\n\nThe strategy will focus on high-probability setups that align with any emerging market trends or patterns as they become identifiable.",
