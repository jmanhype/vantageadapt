      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation until clearer market conditions emerge. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating a potentially high-risk environment where a few trades have resulted in significant gains amidst a larger number of losses. This scenario necessitates a strategy that minimizes risk exposure and prioritizes trade quality over quantity.\n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal for the current market conditions, awaiting more definitive market direction and sentiment. The strategy will focus on stringent risk management parameters, with a low position size to minimize exposure on any given trade. The stop loss and take profit levels will be set conservatively to protect against volatility and to ensure that any trades entered during more favorable conditions are exited with discipline.",
