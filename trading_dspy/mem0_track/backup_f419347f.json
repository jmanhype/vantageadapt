      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective. Instead, a mean reversion strategy could be more suitable, as prices tend to revert to the mean in such markets. The strategy will use technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range, and the moving averages (SMA_20 and SMA_50) to confirm the market's lack of trend. The strategy will aim to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the upper end, capitalizing on the market's tendency to oscillate within a defined range. Risk management will be crucial, given the moderate risk of sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes. Therefore, tight stop losses and conservative position sizing will be employed to manage the risk.",
