      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and the close proximity of the SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price indicates that the market is not trending. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be appropriate, aiming to buy near the lower range of the price and sell near the upper range. The balanced buy/sell ratio implies that there is no strong market sentiment bias, which supports a non-directional strategy. The strategy will use technical indicators such as RSI to identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range, and moving averages to confirm the range boundaries. The low volatility environment suggests that larger position sizes could be used with tighter stop losses and take profits, as price movements are expected to be smaller.",
