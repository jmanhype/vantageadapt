      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown and there's a lack of confidence in the current market analysis, a conservative approach to trading is advisable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significant, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a market that may offer opportunities for significant gains but with considerable risk. Therefore, a strategy that focuses on risk management while attempting to capture potential high-reward trades could be appropriate. The strategy will employ tight stop losses to protect against large losses and a moderate position size to manage exposure. Entry and exit conditions will be based on technical analysis, looking for clear signals of potential market movements. Given the uncertainty in the market regime, the strategy will be flexible, ready to adapt to changing market conditions.",
