  "reasoning": "Given the current market context of a RANGING_LOW_VOL regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within a defined range. The low volatility and neutral RSI suggest that significant price movements are unlikely, making it a suitable environment for range trading. The strategy will involve entering trades at the lower end of the range and exiting at the upper end, while implementing strict risk management to mitigate potential losses. The recent performance indicates a negative average return, which emphasizes the need for careful position sizing and stop-loss placement to protect capital.",
