      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests a high degree of uncertainty and potentially erratic market behavior. The risk level is also unknown, which further complicates the strategy development process. However, the recent performance data indicates a positive average return and P&L, suggesting that some strategies have been effective under current or similar conditions. The overall win rate, although seemingly represented with an incorrect percentage, indicates a positive outcome for a significant number of trades. \n\nIn such uncertain conditions, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management is advisable. The strategy should be flexible, able to adapt to changing market conditions, and not overly reliant on specific market behaviors. A mean reversion strategy might be suitable, as it does not depend on a clear trend and can capitalize on small price movements. The strategy will use technical indicators that perform well in various market conditions, such as moving averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold signals.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy will employ a moderate position size to manage exposure, a tight stop loss to protect against large unexpected moves, and a conservative take profit to ensure gains are captured without excessive risk.",
