      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PnL and an overall win rate, suggesting that some strategies have been effective in the current market conditions. However, the lack of clarity on the market regime means that the strategy should not rely heavily on directional trades but rather on capturing small, consistent gains with tight risk controls. A low-volatility mean reversion strategy could be suitable, aiming to profit from small price reversals within a defined range. This approach is less dependent on market direction and can be adjusted to manage risk effectively. The strategy will use technical indicators to identify overbought and oversold conditions for entry points and will employ tight stop losses and modest take profits to manage risk.",
