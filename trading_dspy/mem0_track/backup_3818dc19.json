      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown and there's a low confidence in the current market analysis, a conservative approach to trading is advisable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade, but the overall win rate is confusingly presented as over 100%, which seems like an error. Assuming the win rate is meant to be a reasonable percentage, the strategy should focus on maintaining a positive edge while managing risk effectively. Without specific market trends or volatility conditions to guide the strategy, a flexible approach that can adapt to changing market conditions is necessary. Therefore, the strategy will incorporate both trend-following and mean-reversion components, using technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points. The strategy will use a moderate position size to manage risk, with tight stop losses to protect against large losses and a reasonable take profit level to ensure profitability.",
