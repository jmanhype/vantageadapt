  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, suggests that the market lacks a clear direction. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective in this environment. This involves buying during temporary weaknesses in a range and selling during temporary strengths. The strategy will use tighter stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively, considering the low volatility. The use of SMA and RSI as primary indicators will help identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range, providing clear entry and exit signals. The strategy will maintain a moderate position size to manage risk, given the market's potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes.",
