      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the current market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. The risk level is also unknown, which adds to the difficulty in formulating a precise strategy. However, the recent performance data indicates a positive average return and PNL, suggesting that some strategies have been successful in the current market conditions. \n\nConsidering the uncertainty in the market regime and risk level, a conservative approach is advisable. The strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, aiming for smaller, consistent gains rather than aggressive trading. A HOLD signal is appropriate until more definitive market trends emerge. \n\nThe strategy will employ tight stop-loss levels to protect against sudden market movements and modest take-profit levels to capture gains in a volatile or uncertain market. Position sizing should be conservative to manage risk effectively. Entry and exit conditions will be based on technical indicators that can adapt to changing market conditions, such as moving averages or RSI, to identify potential trading opportunities when they arise.",
