      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the current market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear trend or pattern that can be reliably acted upon. The risk level being unknown further complicates the strategy development as it's challenging to gauge the market's volatility and risk appetite. However, the recent performance data provides some insights into the market's behavior over the last 7 days, with a total of 123 trades generating a total PnL of 4505.68, an average return of 0.37%, and an average PnL of 450.57 per trade. The overall win rate of 3.11% across 10 strategies analyzed suggests a highly selective market condition where only a few strategies are profitable.\n\nIn such uncertain and selective market conditions, a conservative approach is warranted. The strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, aiming for small, consistent gains rather than large bets. A HOLD signal is appropriate until more definitive market trends emerge. The strategy parameters should reflect a cautious approach, with a low position size to minimize exposure, tight stop loss to protect against sudden market moves, and a modest take profit to capture gains without assuming significant risk.",
