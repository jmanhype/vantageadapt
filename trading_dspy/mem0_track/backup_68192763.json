      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade, which indicates that certain strategies have been effective in the current market conditions. However, the overall win rate is low, suggesting a high variance in trade outcomes. This scenario calls for a strategy that can capitalize on high potential trades while minimizing risk. A balanced approach that combines trend-following and mean reversion principles could be effective, using technical indicators to identify entry and exit points. The strategy will focus on high probability setups, employing tight stop losses to protect against large losses and modest take profit levels to ensure gains are captured efficiently. The use of a moderate position size will balance the need for capital preservation with the opportunity to capitalize on profitable trades.",
