  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA20 and SMA50 to the current price, along with RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, suggests that the market lacks a strong directional trend. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective in this environment. The strategy will aim to buy near the lower end of the range (when prices are perceived as relatively low) and sell near the upper end of the range (when prices are perceived as relatively high). The previous successful parameters indicate a 100% win rate over the last 7 days with a total of 8 trades, suggesting that a cautious approach with tight stop loss and take profit levels has been effective. Given the low volatility, smaller position sizes to manage risk and tighter stop loss and take profit levels are advisable to protect gains and limit losses in a market that may not offer large moves.",
