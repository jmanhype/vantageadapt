    "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies may not be effective, and instead, mean reversion strategies could be more suitable. In a ranging market, prices tend to oscillate between support and resistance levels. Therefore, the strategy will aim to buy near support levels and sell near resistance levels, or vice versa for short positions, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to the mean. The strategy will use technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought and oversold conditions within this range, which can signal potential reversal points. Additionally, moving averages can help confirm the range's boundaries by identifying areas where the price has historically found support or resistance. Given the low volatility, a tighter stop loss can be used to minimize risk, while a conservative take profit level can help lock in gains before the market potentially reverses direction. Position size will be moderate to manage risk effectively, considering the market's potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes as noted in the analysis.",
