      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data suggests a positive average PNL and a high overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the current market conditions. However, without specific details on the market trend, volatility, or sentiment, the strategy should not rely heavily on directional trades but rather on capturing small, consistent gains with tight risk controls.\n\nConsidering these factors, a mean reversion strategy might be suitable, as it does not depend on clear market trends and can capitalize on small price movements. The strategy will use technical indicators to identify overbought and oversold conditions for entry points and will employ tight stop losses and modest take profit levels to manage risk. The strategy will also maintain a low position size to minimize exposure in the uncertain market regime.",
