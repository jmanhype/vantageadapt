      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear indication of the market's direction or volatility level. In such a scenario, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management becomes paramount. The strategy should aim for smaller, more secure gains rather than aggressive trading positions. Given the recent performance data, which shows a positive average PnL and an overall win rate, it's evident that some strategies have been successful in the current market environment. However, the unknown risk level calls for a strategy that is adaptable and can perform well under various market conditions. A balanced approach, possibly focusing on high-probability setups with clear entry and exit conditions, would be advisable. The strategy could use a combination of technical indicators to identify potential trading opportunities, with a strong emphasis on risk management to protect against unforeseen market movements.",
