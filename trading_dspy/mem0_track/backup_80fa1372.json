      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating a potentially high-risk strategy that may not be sustainable in the long term. Therefore, the strategy will aim to improve the win rate through more stringent entry and exit conditions, while still aiming to capture a reasonable return per trade.\n\nConsidering the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy will adopt a neutral stance with a HOLD signal initially. The strategy will be designed to quickly adapt to either buy or sell signals based on specific market conditions identified through technical analysis. The use of a tight stop loss and a conservative take profit level aims to manage risk effectively, while the moderate position size balances between capital preservation and the opportunity for profit.",
