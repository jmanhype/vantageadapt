      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to the current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade and an overall win rate of 3.08%, which indicates some strategies have been successful in the recent past. Without specific market direction or volatility information, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management is advisable. The strategy will aim to make small, consistent gains rather than seeking large profits, which could be more risky in uncertain market conditions. A HOLD signal is recommended until more definitive market trends emerge. The strategy will use a moderate position size to manage exposure, tight stop loss levels to protect against unforeseen market movements, and modest take profit levels to ensure profits are captured without assuming excessive risk.",
