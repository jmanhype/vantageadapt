    "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that trend-following strategies might not perform well, and instead, a mean-reversion approach could be more effective. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price further supports the idea that the market is not trending but oscillating within a range. Therefore, the strategy will use the SMA crossover as a signal for potential mean reversion points, combined with RSI to identify overbought or oversold conditions that may indicate a reversal back to the mean. The strategy will aim to enter trades when the price is expected to revert from an extreme back towards the average range, with tight stop losses to manage risk in the event of a breakout from the range. The use of a moderate position size reflects the moderate confidence in the market's current state and the inherent risk of sudden volatility spikes in a low volatility environment.",
