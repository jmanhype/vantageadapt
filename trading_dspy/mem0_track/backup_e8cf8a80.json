      "reasoning": "Given the market context with an unknown regime and a confidence level of 0.0, it's challenging to deduce a clear market direction or volatility level. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return and profit per trade, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the current conditions. The overall win rate, although presented in an unclear format, seems to suggest some level of success in recent trades. Without specific details on the market regime or risk level, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management becomes paramount.\n\nIn this scenario, a flexible strategy that can adapt to various market conditions is advisable. A mean reversion strategy could be suitable, given the lack of clear market direction, aiming to capitalize on small price corrections. This strategy would involve buying on minor pullbacks in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend, based on the assumption that prices will revert to a mean value over time.\n\nGiven the unknown market conditions, maintaining a moderate position size and employing tight stop losses is crucial to manage risk effectively. The strategy should aim for modest profit targets to ensure trades are closed in profit before any potential market reversal. The use of technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands can help identify entry and exit points, with the indicators adjusted to more conservative settings to reflect the strategy's risk-averse stance.",
