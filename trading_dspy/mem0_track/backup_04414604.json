      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, which indicates that the market might be experiencing high volatility or that the strategies employed previously were high risk. Therefore, the strategy developed should aim to mitigate risk while still capitalizing on potential market movements.\n\nConsidering the lack of specific market direction and the unknown risk level, a neutral market strategy such as a straddle or strangle could be appropriate, allowing for profit from significant market movements in either direction. However, since the task requires a BUY/SELL/HOLD signal rather than options strategies, the focus will be on a very conservative approach to direct market entry.\n\nThe strategy will employ tight stop losses to protect against large unexpected movements and modest take profit levels to ensure profits are captured in a timely manner. Position sizing will be kept low to manage overall exposure. The strategy will use a combination of technical indicators that can adapt to changing market conditions, such as moving averages for trend identification and RSI for overbought/oversold signals, to determine entry and exit points. Given the unknown market conditions, the strategy will prioritize capital preservation over aggressive growth.",
