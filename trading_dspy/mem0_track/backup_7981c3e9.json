      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly adaptable and conservative. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade and a significant overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent market conditions. However, without specific details on the market trend, volatility, or direction, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management while being prepared to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.\n\nConsidering these factors, a flexible approach that can quickly adapt to changing market conditions is essential. The strategy should employ a mix of technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, focusing on short-term trades to reduce exposure. A conservative position size and tight stop loss are recommended to manage the unknown risk, while a reasonable take profit level can help lock in gains.",
