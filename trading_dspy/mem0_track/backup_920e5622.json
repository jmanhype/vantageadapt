      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable to various market conditions. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PnL per trade but with a very low overall win rate, indicating that while most trades are not profitable, a few trades have generated significant returns. This scenario suggests a market that may have sporadic volatility spikes or trend reversals, making it challenging to predict. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, employing a cautious approach to position sizing and stop-loss levels.\n\nGiven the lack of clear market direction and the high variance in trade outcomes, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal as a base stance, waiting for more definitive market signals before taking action. The strategy will employ tight risk management controls, including a low position size and tight stop-loss levels, to protect against sudden market movements. The take profit level will be set conservatively to ensure that any gains can be captured before potential reversals.",
