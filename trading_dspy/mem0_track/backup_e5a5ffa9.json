      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that a mean-reversion strategy could be effective. In such a market, prices tend to oscillate between support and resistance levels without breaking out significantly. The strategy will aim to buy near support levels and sell near resistance levels, or vice versa for short positions, capitalizing on the market's tendency to revert to its mean. The strategy will use technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify potential overbought or oversold conditions within the range, which can signal entry points. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) can also be used to identify momentum shifts within the range, providing additional entry or exit signals. Given the low volatility, a tighter stop loss can be used to minimize risk, while a conservative take profit level ensures that trades are exited before the market potentially reverses direction. The strategy will maintain a moderate position size to manage risk effectively, considering the market's moderate risk level due to potential sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes.",
