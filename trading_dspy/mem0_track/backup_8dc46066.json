    "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective. Instead, a mean reversion strategy could be more suitable, aiming to buy near the lower range and sell near the upper range of the current market price. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price further supports this approach, as these moving averages can act as dynamic support and resistance levels in a ranging market. The balanced buy/sell ratio indicates that there isn't a clear market bias, which is typical for ranging markets. Therefore, the strategy will focus on small, consistent gains rather than large directional bets. Risk management is crucial in such conditions to protect against sudden spikes in volatility or unexpected market movements.",
