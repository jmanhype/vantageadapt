      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain or that there is insufficient data to accurately determine the market's current state. In such scenarios, a conservative approach is advisable to manage the inherent risks. The strategy should focus on capital preservation and risk management, given the lack of clear market direction. The recent performance data indicates a positive average PnL, suggesting that some strategies have been effective in the current market conditions. However, the overall win rate is unusually reported (over 100%), which may indicate a data reporting error or an exceptional scenario that requires cautious interpretation.\n\nConsidering these factors, the strategy will adopt a HOLD signal as a base stance, waiting for more definitive market signals before taking new positions. The strategy parameters will be set conservatively to manage risk effectively:\n\n- A lower position size to minimize exposure.\n- Tight stop loss levels to protect against sudden market movements.\n- Modest take profit levels to ensure gains are captured without expecting large market moves.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, the strategy will focus on monitoring market conditions closely for signs of a clearer trend or regime establishment before making more aggressive trades.",
