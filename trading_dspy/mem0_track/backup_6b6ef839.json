  "reasoning": "Given the market context of a ranging market with low volatility, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The close proximity of SMA20 and SMA50 to the current price, along with RSI values fluctuating around the mid-range, suggests that the market lacks a strong directional trend. Therefore, a mean reversion strategy could be effective in this environment. The strategy will aim to buy on dips and sell on rallies within the range, using the SMA20 as a reference point for the market's mean. The low volatility suggests that larger price swings are less likely, allowing for tighter stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively. The recent performance data showing a high win rate with a moderate average return per trade indicates that a conservative approach to position sizing and risk management has been successful in the current market conditions.",
