      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative and adaptable. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average PNL per trade and an overall win rate of 3.08%, which is quite low. This indicates that while the trades that do win are profitable, the win rate is very low, suggesting a high-risk environment or a strategy that is not well aligned with market conditions. Therefore, the strategy developed should aim to improve the win rate while maintaining a reasonable level of profitability per trade.\n\nConsidering the lack of clear market direction and the unknown risk level, the strategy will focus on capital preservation and risk management. The strategy will employ a HOLD signal initially until more definitive market conditions can be identified. The strategy parameters will be set conservatively to ensure that if a trade is taken, the risk is minimized.",
