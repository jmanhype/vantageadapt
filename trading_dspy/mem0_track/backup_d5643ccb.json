      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, it's challenging to tailor a strategy specifically to current market conditions. However, the recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade and a significant overall win rate, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. Without specific details on market trends, volatility, or direction, a conservative approach focusing on risk management is advisable. A strategy that can adapt to various market conditions, such as a mean reversion strategy that looks for price corrections within a broader trend, could be effective. This approach is supported by the recent performance data, which implies that even in an undefined market regime, there have been identifiable, profitable trade opportunities. The strategy will use technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points, with a focus on managing risk through tight stop losses and moderate take profits.",
