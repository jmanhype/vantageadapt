      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, it suggests that the market conditions are highly uncertain, and there is no clear indication of the market's direction or volatility level. In such a scenario, a conservative approach focusing on capital preservation and risk management becomes paramount. The strategy should be flexible, capable of adapting to both potential low and high volatility scenarios. A mean reversion strategy might be too risky without clear indicators of market regime, while a trend-following strategy could lead to false signals due to the regime's uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, the strategy will focus on short-term, opportunistic trades based on price action and volume, avoiding reliance on a specific market direction. The strategy will use tight stop losses to protect against sudden market moves and moderate take profit levels to ensure profits are captured in an uncertain market. The position size will be kept low to manage risk effectively.\n\nGiven the recent performance data, despite the overall win rate being low, the average PnL per trade is positive, suggesting that a strategy focusing on a higher win rate with controlled losses could capitalize on the market's current conditions.",
