      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown and there's a lack of confidence in the current market analysis, a conservative approach is warranted. The recent performance data suggests a relatively high average return per trade but with a low overall win rate, indicating that while profitable trades are significantly beneficial, they are infrequent. This scenario suggests a market that may offer opportunities for high reward but at a higher risk. Therefore, the strategy should focus on capital preservation while attempting to capture opportunities that present a favorable risk-reward ratio. A cautious position size is recommended to manage the inherent risk, along with tight stop loss levels to protect against unexpected market movements. The take profit level should be set ambitiously to capture the potential high reward per trade, as indicated by the recent performance data. The strategy will employ technical and fundamental analysis to identify entry and exit conditions, focusing on high conviction trades to improve the win rate.",
