      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown and there's a lack of confidence in the current market analysis, a conservative approach is warranted. The recent performance data suggests a high overall win rate and a positive average PnL, indicating that strategies employed in the past week have been effective. However, without specific details on the market conditions that led to this performance, it's prudent to adopt a strategy that is flexible and can adapt to various market conditions. A mean reversion strategy could be suitable in this scenario, as it does not rely heavily on trend direction and can perform well in both volatile and stable markets. This strategy will focus on identifying overbought and oversold conditions using technical indicators, aiming to buy low and sell high within a relatively short timeframe. The strategy will employ tight stop losses to protect against significant losses and modest take profit levels to ensure gains are captured in uncertain market conditions.",
