      "reasoning": "Given the market regime is unknown with a confidence level of 0.0, and the risk level is also unknown, the strategy must be highly conservative, focusing on capital preservation and risk management. The recent performance data suggests a high overall win rate and a positive average PnL, indicating that certain strategies have been effective in the recent past. However, without specific details on the market conditions that led to this performance, the strategy should not rely heavily on past success. Therefore, a balanced approach that can adapt to both potential volatility and range-bound conditions is advisable. The strategy will employ technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points, with a focus on short-term price movements to reduce exposure to unforeseen market shifts. Risk management will be paramount, with tight stop losses to protect against large losses and modest position sizes to ensure that any single trade does not significantly impact the overall portfolio.",
