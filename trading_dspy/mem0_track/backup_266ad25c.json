      "reasoning": "Given the market is in a ranging low volatility regime, the strategy should focus on capturing small price movements within the range. The lack of strong directional movement suggests that breakout strategies might not be effective. Instead, a mean reversion strategy could be more suitable, aiming to buy at the lower end of the range and sell at the higher end. The close proximity of SMA_20 and SMA_50 to the current price, along with balanced buy/sell ratios, supports the idea that prices are likely to revert to their mean rather than break out in a new direction. The strategy will use technical indicators such as RSI to identify overbought and oversold conditions within this range, combined with SMA to confirm the price is near the expected mean reversion points. Given the low volatility, a tighter stop loss can be used to minimize risk, while a modest take profit level can help capture gains within the range. The strategy will maintain a conservative position size due to the moderate risk of sudden direction changes or volatility spikes as noted in the market analysis.",
