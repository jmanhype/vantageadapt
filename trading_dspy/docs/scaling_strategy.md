# Scaling Trading System to Production Targets

This document outlines strategic recommendations to bridge the gap between the current prototype trading system and production targets as defined in the roadmap.

## Current Performance Analysis

Based on recent test runs, the system demonstrates:

- **Total Return**: ~3% (target: 100%+)
- **Win Rate**: 100% (very promising)
- **Total Trades**: 4 trades (target: 1000+)
- **Sortino Ratio**: ~13.6 (target: >15)
- **Assets Traded**: 1 (target: 100+)

The system architecture is sound but requires scaling across multiple dimensions to reach production targets.

## 1. Expand Asset Coverage

- **Implement multi-asset tracking**: Currently only trading $MICHI, expand to multiple assets
- **Create asset selection module**: Use DSPy to build a module that identifies promising assets based on market data
- **Asset categorization**: Group similar assets to apply appropriate strategies across categories
- **Market correlation analysis**: Identify diversification opportunities and avoid correlated assets
- **Sector-specific strategies**: Develop specialized approaches for different asset classes

## 2. Increase Trade Frequency

- **Modify entry conditions**: Current conditions are too restrictive (RSI < 30 or > 70)
- **Add timeframe diversity**: Implement strategies across multiple timeframes (1h, 4h, 1d)
- **Parameter optimization**: Current backtesting finds good parameters but frequency is low
- **Reduce entry thresholds**: Create more aggressive parameter sets when confidence is high
- **Implement time-based entries**: Add scheduled rebalancing for specific assets/conditions

## 3. Improve DSPy Pipeline

- **Add more seed examples**: Current setup uses only 2 examples for bootstrapping
- **Increase bootstrap rounds**: Expand from 1 to 3-5 rounds for more thorough learning
- **Implement KNN few-shot learning**: Use similarity-based strategy selection (Q2 roadmap)
- **Train on successful strategies**: Use best performers to bootstrap new improved versions
- **Full trace debugging**: Analyze why current bootstrapping attempts fail to complete full traces
- **Prompt engineering**: Refine prompt templates for better strategy generation

## 4. Advanced Optimizations

- **Fix memory system**: Logs show "Error storing pre-structured strategy" 
- **Implement Bayesian optimization**: Accelerate Q3 roadmap item for parameter tuning
- **Add vector store integration**: Store and retrieve successful strategies as vectors with feature metadata
- **Dynamic parameter adjustment**: Adjust parameters based on changing market conditions
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Balance risk/reward, trade frequency, and win rate
- **Ensemble strategies**: Combine multiple strategies for more robust performance

## 5. Technical Improvements

- **Fix prompt templating**: Ensure prompts encourage more aggressive trade generation
- **Regime-specific strategies**: Train specialized models for each market regime
- **Increase confidence thresholds**: Only deploy strategies with high confidence scores
- **Performance tracking**: Implement comprehensive tracking of all metrics in database
- **System monitoring**: Add alerts for system performance degradation
- **Automated failover**: Implement safety mechanisms for strategy failures

## Implementation Priority

1. Increase trade frequency (immediate impact)
2. Fix memory system issues (critical for learning)
3. Expand to multiple assets (scale potential)
4. Implement KNN few-shot learning (improve quality)
5. Add Bayesian optimization (enhance parameters)

The most critical limitation appears to be trade frequency, which is directly linked to restrictive entry/exit conditions and single-asset focus.

## Next Steps

1. Review and modify entry/exit condition generation
2. Fix memory system for reliable strategy storage
3. Create asset selection module for multi-asset trading
4. Begin KNN implementation for strategy matching
5. Increase seed examples for bootstrapping
