### 2. **main_hybrid_real_data.py** (PID: 70574)
**File:** `/Users/speed/vantageadapt/trading_dspy/main_hybrid_real_data.py`
**Output Log:** `hybrid_trading_output.log`
**What it does:** The FULL hybrid system combining ML + DSPy + Memory

#### Results from THIS system:
Currently showing API calls to GPT-4o-mini, which means it's running the DSPy pipeline component. The earlier ML training completed but we haven't seen the final results yet because it's still processing.
