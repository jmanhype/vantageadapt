In such conditions, volatility is lower, meaning price movements are less dramatic, and the market does not trend strongly in one direction. This environment is suitable for range-bound strategies that aim to buy at support levels and sell at resistance levels within the range. The strategy should employ tight stop losses to minimize losses if the market breaks out of the range unexpectedly. A moderate position size is recommended to manage risk effectively while still capitalizing on trade opportunities. The strategy will use technical indicators like Moving Averages (MAs) to identify potential entry and exit points within the range.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) will also be utilized to identify overbought or oversold conditions, providing additional entry or exit signals within the ranging market.

The price change percentage is minimal, indicating a lack of strong directional movement. The RSI values fluctuate around the mid-range without showing extreme overbought or oversold conditions, which supports the ranging market assessment. The moving averages (SMA_20 and SMA_50) are very close to each other and to the current price, further indicating a lack of strong trend. Volume data does not show significant spikes, which often accompany trend reversals or breakouts, reinforcing the low volatility environment. The buy/sell ratio and its variations across different periods show a balanced market sentiment without a clear dominance of buying or selling pressure. Overall, the market is in a low volatility range, with moderate risk due to the potential for sudden changes in direction or volatility spikes.\""
