## Why These Are "Emotions Before Market Moves"

Kate's key insight: Traditional crypto traders focus on **price action AFTER emotions**. These APIs capture **emotions BEFORE they manifest in price**:

1. **Order Book Psychology** (Databento) - Shows intentions before execution
2. **Options Positioning** (Amberdata) - Reveals institutional sentiment through derivatives
3. **Whale Behavior** (Whale Alert/Nansen) - Smart money moves before retail
4. **Community Fear/Greed** (Discord/CFGI) - Sentiment before crowd acts
5. **On-Chain Psychology** (Glassnode) - Holder behavior before selling/buying
6. **News Sentiment Scoring** (Alpha Vantage) - Quantified emotions before price impact

## Implementation Strategy

       absorption_patterns=identify_liquidity_absorption()
   )
   ```

       realtime=True
   )
   ```

3. **Discord LLM Sentiment Analysis**
   ```python
   # Real-time community emotion tracking
   discord_sentiment = vbt.search_discord_sentiment(

def calculate_market_emotion():
    signals = {
        'order_book_emotion': analyze_databento_flow(),
        'news_sentiment': get_alpha_vantage_sentiment(),
        'community_emotion': analyze_discord_sentiment(),
        'whale_behavior': track_whale_movements(),
        'options_positioning': analyze_derivatives_flow(),
        'on_chain_psychology': get_glassnode_metrics(),
        'smart_money_moves': track_nansen_signals()
    }
    
    # Weight each signal based on historical accuracy
    weights = {
        'order_book_emotion': 0.25,
        'whale_behavior': 0.20,
        'options_positioning': 0.15,
        'news_sentiment': 0.15,
        'community_emotion': 0.10,
        'on_chain_psychology': 0.10,
        'smart_money_moves': 0.05
    }
    
    composite_emotion = sum(
        signals[key] * weights[key] 
        for key in signals.keys()
    )
    
    return composite_emotion
```
