# DSPy System Archaeological Report
## Trading System Architecture Deep Dive

## Executive Summary
This trading system represents a sophisticated compound AI architecture that combines DSPy's language-model programming paradigm with traditional ML models and memory systems. The system uses a 60/30/10 weighted architecture where ML models contribute 60%, regime-based strategies 30%, and DSPy creative insights 10% to final trading decisions.

## DSPy Components and Architecture

### 1. Core DSPy Modules

#### A. Market Analysis Module (`market_analysis.py`)
- **Type**: Uses `ChainOfThought` reasoning (inherits from DSPy ChainOfThought)
- **Signature**: 
  ```python
  "market_data: dict, timeframe: str, prompt: str -> 
   regime: str, confidence: float, risk_level: str, analysis: str"
  ```
- **Purpose**: Analyzes market conditions using CoT reasoning to determine market regime
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic data windowing during optimization (20-100 data points)
  - Multiple sampling strategies: random_window, segment_based, volatility_biased, recent_biased
  - Falls back to MarketRegimeClassifier for robust classification

#### B. Strategy Generator Module (`strategy_generator.py`)
- **Type**: Uses `dspy.Predict` with custom signature
- **Signature**:
  ```python
  """market_context: dict, theme: str, base_parameters: dict, prompt: str -> 
  reasoning: str, trade_signal: str, parameters: dict, parameter_ranges: dict,
  confidence: float, entry_conditions: list, exit_conditions: list, indicators: list"""
  ```
- **Purpose**: Generates complete trading strategies with parameter ranges for optimization
- **Key Features**:
  - Enforces parameter_ranges output for optimization bounds
  - Integrates with TradingMemoryManager for strategy persistence
  - Custom deepcopy implementation to handle memory manager references

#### C. Trading Rules Generator (`trading_rules.py`)
- **Type**: Uses `dspy.Predict` 
- **Signature**:
  ```python
  "strategy_insights: dict, market_context: dict, prompt: str -> 
   entry_conditions: list[str], exit_conditions: list[str], 
   parameters: dict, reasoning: str, indicators: list[str]"
  ```
- **Purpose**: Generates executable trading rules from strategy insights
- **Key Features**:
  - Mandatory indicators field to prevent execution errors
  - Condition validation and standardization
  - Python expression generation for backtesting

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Implementation

The system implements CoT in the MarketAnalyzer class:
- Inherits from `dspy.ChainOfThought`
- Uses step-by-step reasoning for market analysis
- Provides intermediate reasoning steps before final classification
- Falls back to direct classification if CoT fails

### 3. Memory Integration Pattern

#### TradingMemoryManager Integration:
- **Storage Pattern**: Strategies stored with performance metrics
- **Query Pattern**: Retrieves similar successful strategies by market regime
- **Key Storage Fields**:
  - Market regime and confidence
  - Strategy parameters and ranges
  - Performance metrics (return, Sortino ratio, win rate)
  - Weighted score for strategy ranking

#### Memory Flow:
1. Strategy generated → Validated → Stored with UUID
2. Performance tracked → Results stored with strategy reference
3. Future queries retrieve successful strategies for similar regimes
4. Strategies ranked by composite score (0.4×return + 0.3×sortino + 0.3×win_rate)

### 4. MiPro Optimization Integration

#### MiProWrapper Configuration:
- Uses MIPROv2 (MIPRO deprecated)
- **Key Parameters**:
  - `max_bootstrapped_demos`: 5 (increased for diversity)
  - `num_candidate_programs`: 15 (increased for exploration)
  - `temperature`: 0.8
  - Minibatching enabled for datasets ≥3 examples

#### Optimization Process:
1. **Bootstrapping**: Creates synthetic examples from successful executions
2. **Grounded Proposal**: Generates candidate prompts based on examples
3. **Discrete Search**: Tests candidates and selects best performer
4. **Plateau Detection**: Restarts optimization if no improvement

### 5. Pipeline Flow Architecture

### 6. Hybrid Architecture (60/30/10 Weights)

The `HybridTradingSystem` combines three components:

1. **ML Models (60% weight)**:
   - Trained on historical data
   - Provides probability-based signals
   - Learns from actual market patterns

2. **Regime Strategies (30% weight)**:
   - Weight scales with regime confidence
   - Adapts strategy to market conditions
   - Uses regime-specific optimizations

3. **DSPy Insights (10% weight)**:
   - Provides creative/exploratory strategies
   - Handles edge cases ML might miss
   - Generates novel approaches

### 7. Key DSPy Signatures and Types

#### Input/Output Types:
- **MarketRegime**: Enum with values TRENDING_BULLISH, TRENDING_BEARISH, RANGING_HIGH_VOL, RANGING_LOW_VOL, UNKNOWN
- **StrategyContext**: Contains regime, confidence, risk_level, parameters
- **BacktestResults**: Performance metrics including return, Sortino ratio, win rate

#### Signature Patterns:
- All modules use structured input → structured output signatures
- Outputs include confidence scores for weighted combination
- Parameters include ranges for optimization bounds

### 8. Aggressive Trading Modifications Potential

To make the system more aggressive for high-volume trading:

1. **Reduce Data Windows**: Change market analysis window from 20 to 5-10 points
2. **Increase Position Sizes**: Modify parameter_ranges for larger positions
3. **Tighter Stop Losses**: Reduce stop_loss ranges for faster exits
4. **Higher Frequency Indicators**: Add tick-level or minute-level indicators
5. **Parallel Signal Generation**: Run multiple DSPy chains concurrently
6. **Reduce Confidence Thresholds**: Lower combined_confidence requirement from 0.6 to 0.4
7. **Add Momentum Bias**: Weight recent price action more heavily in analysis

### 9. Critical Integration Points

1. **Memory Manager**: Must be initialized before strategy storage
2. **Prompt Manager**: Handles template loading and optimization storage
3. **Data Preprocessor**: Adds technical indicators required by conditions
4. **VectorBTPro**: Requires GitHub token for private package access
5. **Mem0 Client**: Needs API key and proper error handling

### 10. Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Prompt templates cached after first load
2. **Batch Processing**: Multiple examples processed together in MiPro
3. **Async Execution**: Pipeline supports async for concurrent operations
4. **Memory Queries**: Limited to top 5 strategies to reduce latency
5. **Conditional Storage**: Only successful strategies stored to reduce noise

This archaeological investigation reveals a sophisticated system that elegantly combines the flexibility of DSPy with the learning capabilities of traditional ML, all orchestrated through a weighted ensemble approach that adapts to market conditions.
