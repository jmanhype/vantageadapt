## 🔄 Estimated Completion Time

Based on current progress:
- **Per Token**: ~12 minutes (training + evaluation)
- **50 Tokens**: ~10 hours total
- **Completion**: Around 23:00 CDT tonight

## 📈 Expected Final Results

When complete, we'll have:
1. **Performance metrics** for 50 real crypto assets
2. **Total trades** across all assets (likely 1000+)
3. **Aggregate return** calculation
4. **Win rate** statistics
5. **Full evaluation** against Kagan's 5 requirements

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Let systems complete processing all 50 tokens
2. Aggregate results across all assets
3. Calculate final performance metrics
4. Generate comprehensive evaluation report
5. Compare against Kagan's benchmarks

## 📝 Notes

- Systems are running autonomously with `nohup`
- All components (ML, DSPy, Memory) are active
- Using REAL data from `/Users/speed/StratOptimv4/big_optimize_1016.pkl`
- No errors detected - smooth processing
