00:00Kagen AtkinsonI mean, obviously, you know, anytime you can replace a human with an LLM and it works good, like that's a good thing. But the question is it too because unrealistic, I guess, in the capability, mismatch, expectations. 
00:23Jay GuthrieYeah. So there was actually. Did I send it to. I'm not sure. There was a couple papers that was. 
00:31Kagen AtkinsonAnd no one else is doing this stuff. Like, I see there's Trader GPT by that guy, that scammer Indian guy. But it looks kind of like a scam. Like, is there anyone else to grab insights from? I would imagine not. We looked a lot, right? 
00:43Jay GuthrieYeah. So there's actually a paper that came out recently that kind of goes over, you know, using GPT4 for, you know, trading and stuff like that. I think I still have the paper somewhere in my folders and whatnot. But yeah, there are researchers that are using, you know, GPT4 in order to analyze and improve trading, but they're not doing it on any type of crypto markets. They're just doing it on like the NASDAQ and stuff. 
01:23Kagen AtkinsonThat shouldn't matter. I mean, the market should be independent. 
01:26Jay GuthrieOh, yeah. 
01:26Kagen AtkinsonI mean, what we're doing is not like rocket science, right? Like, it's some. There's a process in the real world and we're just automating that process. So I think it's feasible. Yeah, can you let me into the Google and I'll give you the pitch and then. 
01:40Jay GuthrieYeah, let me invite you right now. All right, let me, let me exit this call. 
01:53Kagen AtkinsonOkay. Can you hear me? 
01:54Jay GuthrieYeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me? 
01:56Kagen AtkinsonYeah. Okay. So yeah, the vision is ultimately that you provide some sort of direction or theme for the LLM to, you know, or for the pipeline to research. An example would be, you know, look at using, you know, volume as a way to, as a way like as an indicator to trade and to enter or to exit the market or use some type of predictive model to, you know, predict good entries and exits. And from there the model would, or the LLM would write the trading logic in a more advanced sense. It would need to prepare data. I think for now we decided that we would prepare data, right? But eventually it could prepare its own data and then from there it would use the parameterized, you know, grid search style backtest to provide a range of params for each of the trading rules. 
03:18Kagen AtkinsonAnd it would pass, you know, hundreds of scenarios across the portfolio the same way that I provided it in later versions. We would swap that out for optuna and then those outputs. Why is that super loud? 
03:40Jay GuthrieNo, it's perfect. 
03:42Kagen AtkinsonOkay. There's some noise in my background. So then in future versions or. No, sorry. So. So then it would get a response. Well, it would get the output of the overall portfolio and it would, you know, have the statistics, the return, the amount of trades, the average P L per trade, the, you know, max position size across the portfolio. That, that specifically isn't something I've talked about, but I can, you know, add those things. So any arbitrary stat that happens at a portfolio level would be logged into a database, you know, with the trading logic and the params that were used. And then from there we would have predefined, you know, the amount of times we want the LLM to kind of iterate through the trading logic. And it would basically run another. 
04:44Kagen AtkinsonI mean the LLM would then review the statistics that are outputted from the portfolio and you know, and in more advanced sense it would actually look at the comparison between the individual assets in each in the portfolio. So which assets are doing better, which assets are doing worse as it's iterating through the new runs. And so each run would be an entire parameterized or whatever, an entire grid search. Right. So we covered the first one. It outputs the portfolio stats and maybe we output like the top. A sample of whatever. For now call it, we store every single stat for the individual coin. Right. Then on the next run the LLM would make it some sort of change based on the output, so say the itself. Okay. This doesn't meet the expectations of a good strategy. 
05:50Kagen AtkinsonSo I guess at the beginning of the, of this whole process we would need to give it kind of some benchmarks to work with. So I could say like, don't like a good strategy has these properties which would be it has to return, you know, let's call it at least 100%, trade at least a thousand times, trade at least 100 assets. Right. And so those things would need to be met as a benchmark. And so it can kind of use that as a base requirement. And so using the base requirement, it would assess after that first run where we're at. And then from there it would start trying new trading logic and rerunning the parameter, the grid search, storing the results and continuing on. That make sense? 
06:39Jay GuthrieYeah, completely. 
06:40Kagen AtkinsonThat's kind of it, right? I mean, am I missing anything? There's other advanced things like data prep, but yeah, that's really it. We're kind of just adding a little Bit. Yeah. This is not hard. You can do this. You're close. All right. I believe. 
06:57Jay GuthrieRight. We're right at the tip. Yep. 
07:01Kagen AtkinsonBecause there's right now, like, if we can, like me and the font are constantly, you know, tweaking these parameters here and there. But sure, we'll better at it than the LLM. Right. But if the LLM can just be running in perpetuity in the cloud, just trying random. If it can just be doing things slightly better than random, that's good. Right, because that means you're at least, you're at least like optimizing in an efficient way. You can't do. You can't search everything. Right. The whole point of the game is that you need to reduce your search space. So the humans are really good at doing it. If the LLM can reduce search space by, you know, 50 of what I can, then that's great. And it can, we can just run it longer, right? Who cares, as long as it's autonomous? So. 
07:51Jay GuthrieThat's right. 
07:55Kagen AtkinsonI think that is it. Let me, let me look at the agreement here and see if I'm missing anything. But yeah, then the other stuff, I mean, yeah, looking just having the ability to kind of monitor what the LLM is doing from the, you know, tracing and Lane Smith and then also just visualizing a little bit of like being able to look at the changes in performance in the runs in a. And a dashboard will be nice. And then. Yeah, I would say that the final and very important part is that the ability for me to modify prompts, it all needs to be in a centralized place. I don't want to be searching high and low for prompts. All the prompts should be in one place. And I should be able to change the way that it's assessing every single LLM. Right. 
08:50Kagen AtkinsonSo I should be able to modify the prompts there. So when it's making trading logic rule, you know, recommendations, I should be able to provide ad hoc new ideas for it in future, more advanced versions, I think we could kind of have more of a vector store like we talked about and dump some of those articles in there and just kind of let it randomly search through them in a future version. For now, I don't think we need to do that. And yeah, and then in terms of like analyzing the differences between runs, I'm assuming I'm going to need to provide it some tools and in which it can better analyze them. So looking at just. So basically it's actually just that There should be more stats. Right. So don't give the thing too much freedom. So it should just be. 
09:54Kagen AtkinsonWe have more statistical outputs for it. So that would. A good example of that would be we create a tool, whatever a function that returns like the types of trades that happened that led to the worst and the best trades. Right. So we could say, and we kind of just output that and tell it what happened to the market. Like the price went down consecutively for one hour. We bought five times and kept getting stopped out. That's just super high level. Right. So if you could tell that, then it's going to need that information. I think in a more advanced version we plot it and see if it can intuit anything from that as well. And the plot would just be, you know, the price with the entries and the return over time. 
10:56Jay GuthrieOkay. Okay, one last question. So. Or not. One last. Here's a quick question. So would it be easier to. Because it seems like this, there would be some sort of chatting going on with the system. Would it be easier for you to interface with it if it was a discord bot? 
11:17Kagen AtkinsonNo, because the chatting should just, the interaction should just be. I'm seeing something in Lang Trace. I don't like it. I go modify the prompt and see how it goes differently. 
11:28Jay GuthrieOh, okay. I got you. Yeah, I got you. 
11:30Kagen AtkinsonWe want to reduce all the variants of an agent. This isn't really an agent, to be honest. I, I guess I was corrected by somebody else. Agents are a little bit more of like free flowing, I guess. More. Yeah, this is really like, this is just a pipeline for, with an LLM powered like pipeline, basically. 
11:53Jay GuthrieExactly, exactly. 
11:55Kagen AtkinsonOnce you don't need. Which is why like going down the meta, like all those routes that went down initially, they were just added kind of complexity. Right. And even. And there might be some cases for adding tool selection, but tool selection just implies that you have variance in your inputs and outputs. So for example, if you're chatting with something and I want to know what the weather is versus a general chat, like that's extreme variance. Now you need to go get weather data. But for us we kind of know all the data is, you know, the inputs and outputs are static. Right. I'm always trading, I'm always giving it the same stats. I don't think giving it an open ended toolkit is gonna be valuable. 
12:49Jay GuthrieNo, it just creates more confusion and more errors. That's what, that's kind of like what I. Like you said, that's what I went through initially. 
12:58Kagen AtkinsonYeah, so we'll just. Yeah, we'll ignore all that, I think. Yeah, that was a little bit of a miss scoping maybe, or at least a mis describing from my end. I, I always just kind of assumed like I just always equated an agent to an LLM. But I guess in formal terms that's wrong. 
13:22Jay GuthrieGotcha. Gotcha. All right, so basically right now I think we have everything detailed as far as the actual updated scope of the project as far as where we're at. So as of right now, I just have to, you know, like you said, make sure that we get all the outputs traced correctly and then stored in a database after we get the LLM analysis set up and everything running. And then make sure that we have, you know, like you said, the prompt stored in one central location, you know, easily adjustable so that you can ad hoc give it new know ways to analyze the data. 
14:07Jay GuthrieThen we also need to give it some sort of benchmarking data that it actually uses as a guardrail and then use that going forward in all of the evaluations and then give it a new database for storing because I believe we'll have two. Two stores of data. One will be for the. 
14:39Kagen AtkinsonInstead of, instead of us chatting about this, why don't I do this? 
14:43Jay GuthrieOh yeah, I know you're busy. I'm. 
14:44Kagen AtkinsonHave the AI because I just. Yeah, have the AI review what I said, redocument it, send it over to me and then tell me the next to do steps. 
14:56Jay GuthrieOkay. 
14:57Kagen AtkinsonAnd I understand. 
14:58Jay GuthrieYeah, payment and then the next meeting goes. Will we be able to do that tomorrow? 
15:04Kagen AtkinsonYeah, I mean I think the. I will pay you this milestone. I do think it is like loosely met, but I am going to be much more strict on the next one because it's still a little bit hard for me to evaluate at this stage and I don't have time to get in the weeds. So just note that the next milestones will be more strict. I will pay you this one. Yeah, the next one's like, I'm not going to let anything slip, so. And then also note that there is way more work to be done after these five milestones. So don't think that, you know, there's only 6K. Like there could easily be a ton more work if you do a good job. So I will keep that. 
15:54Jay GuthrieExcellent. 
15:55Kagen AtkinsonYeah, I don't have time. So like I'm just going to keep saying it and make it better and then how did I pay you last time? Was it a wire? 
16:04Jay GuthrieYes, it was a wire. Thank you. Still have the information? I can resend it. Let me see if I. 
16:18Kagen AtkinsonNo, it's already in my bank. It's fine. So. Yeah, that'll go out today or tomorrow. Are you there?
