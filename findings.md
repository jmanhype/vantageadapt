## Trading System Integration Plan

1. Component Mapping:
   - `strategy_generator.py` → Task implementation
   - `backtester.py` → Evaluation framework
   - `prompt_manager.py` → Goal prompt and task prompts
   - `llm_interface.py` → Agent LLM interaction

2. Implementation Steps:
   a. Create trading-specific task structure:
      - Define trading strategy generation as a task
      - Implement evaluation metrics
      - Set up performance thresholds
   
   b. Adapt Gödel Agent:
      - Customize goal prompt for trading
      - Define trading-specific actions
      - Implement strategy evolution logic
   
   c. Integration:
      - Connect with existing backtester
      - Link to prompt management system
      - Set up performance monitoring
   
   d. Safety & Monitoring:
      - Implement trading-specific error handling
      - Set up performance tracking
      - Create rollback mechanisms

3. Timeline:
   - Phase 1: Basic integration (1-2 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Testing & refinement (1 week)
   - Phase 3: Production deployment (1 week)
   - Phase 4: Monitoring & optimization (ongoing)

## Next Steps

1. Create trading-specific task implementation
2. Adapt goal prompt for trading context
3. Set up integration test environment
4. Begin phased implementation
