Adaptive regime multiplier mechanism: Provide explicit steps for Bayesian optimization,
  enumerating inputs such as price, volume, and volatility, and clearly define desired
  outputs, like entry/exit signals or position sizing adjustments.
After Entry conditions: Deploy a liquidity assessment model that takes into account
  the average order book depth and recent volume patterns to minimize execution costs
  and slippage.
After Entry conditions - regime-specific breakout thresholds: Clarify the machine
  learning techniques suitable for low-volatility RANGING_LOW_VOL environments by
  providing relevant algorithm examples and detailing their applicability to breakout
  detection.
After adaptive regime multiplier mechanism: Detail steps for integrating a neural
  network with statistical validation tests, to form a hybrid model that can more
  effectively distinguish pattern recognition from noise specifically in low-volatility
  markets.
After risk management parameters: Revise the existing VaR model for the RANGING_LOW_VOL
  landscape by calibrating it to better predict and prepare for market shifts that
  are less frequent but potentially severe.
After streamlining mean reversion techniques: Specify the approach for 'adaptive grid
  optimization' in parameter search algorithms, and describe how it improves mean
  reversion threshold calibration.
Conditions - entry: Incorporate an asymmetry factor into the volatility model for
  entry conditions, to account for the differing market reactions to upward versus
  downward price movements in the current regime.
Current rules prompt - parameters: Introduce a dynamically adjusting grid within the
  Differential Evolution algorithm to fine-tune exploration and exploitation balance,
  promoting efficient search for optimal parameters.
Entry conditions: Implement an adaptive layer that updates entry thresholds in real-time
  based on short-term volatility contraction and expansion cycles, even within a low
  volatility environment.
Entry conditions - regime-specific breakout thresholds: Demonstrate the application
  of CNNs and the attention mechanism with examples or scenarios where they would
  improve breakout detection.
New Section After Current Rules Prompt - parameters: Define the parameters and conditions
  that trigger the 'cooling period', ensuring that the system avoids overfitting and
  maintains adaptiveness to the market by inducing strategy diversity.
New section after regime_specific_rules: Embed an adaptive feedback mechanism in real-time
  that recalibrates strategy weights based on recent performance, market autocorrelation,
  and current conditions for ongoing strategic learning.
Risk management enhancement: Expand the GARCH model's usage by including extreme value
  theory parameters tailored for RANGING_LOW_VOL regimes; for example, adjust the
  tail index based on observed loss distributions during such market conditions.
Risk management parameters: Update the existing risk management framework to include
  Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) which considers the severity of tail losses, thereby
  providing a complementary risk perspective during low-volatility periods.
Risk_management: Introduce clear metrics for the 'resilience metric' and describe
  how it impacts position sizing adjustments.
Streamline mean reversion techniques: Adjust the Kalman Filter parameters to better
  reflect the low volatility environment, allowing for a more responsive adaptation
  to market changes with an emphasis on minimizing false signals.
adaptive regime multiplier mechanism: Adjust the machine learning model's loss function
  to penalize misclassification of the current regime more severely, ensuring greater
  sensitivity to RANGING_LOW_VOL conditions.
current rules prompt - parameters: Integrate a performance-based feedback system that
  automatically suggests parameter adjustments in the Differential Evolution algorithm,
  fostering continuous improvement based on recent strategy successes and failures.
regime_specific_rules: Integrate dynamic weighting adjustments into the strategy based
  on recent performance and evolving correlations, using a multi-armed bandit approach.
risk management parameters: Introduce a layered approach to risk management that factors
  in the unique attributes of RANGING_LOW_VOL, such as incorporating liquidity-adjusted
  stop-losses.
risk_management: Develop clear criteria for the proposed 'resilience metric', specifying
  the computations and thresholds that adjust position sizes responsively in the context
  of a RANGING_LOW_VOL environment.
risk_management rules for RANGING_LOW_VOL regime: More precisely define 'liquidity-adjusted
  risk metrics', explaining in detail how they enhance risk management strategies
  in a low volatility market by managing exposure to liquidity risk.
risk_management_parameters: Update the risk management framework to provide specific
  CVaR calculation methods and implementation guidelines tailored to RANGING_LOW_VOL
  conditions.
streamline mean reversion techniques: Adjust the Kalman Filter settings to respond
  more quickly to price variations while reducing noise impact in the low-volatility
  regime by calibrating the measurement and process noise covariances to current market
  conditions.
system: Streamline the systematic feedback loop to not only revise Differential Evolution
  parameters but also dynamically adapt entry and exit rules based on leading indicators
  of volatility and inter-market analysis, enhancing the strategy's sensitivity to
  shifts in market regime.
