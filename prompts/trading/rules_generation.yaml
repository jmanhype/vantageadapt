  Differential Evolution algorithm to fine-tune exploration and exploitation balance,
  promoting efficient search for optimal parameters.
Entry conditions: Implement an adaptive layer that updates entry thresholds in real-time
  based on short-term volatility contraction and expansion cycles, even within a low
  volatility environment.
Entry conditions - regime-specific breakout thresholds: Combine CNN outputs with an
  attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most relevant features of price,
  volume, and order book data, thus improving the robustness and reliability of the
  breakout detection process.
New Section After Current Rules Prompt - parameters: Implement a 'cooling period'
  parameter within the adaptive grid search to temporarily exclude certain areas from
  consideration after extensive exploration, avoiding overfitting and promoting parameter
  diversity.
New section after regime_specific_rules: Embed an adaptive feedback mechanism in real-time
  that recalibrates strategy weights based on recent performance, market autocorrelation,
  and current conditions for ongoing strategic learning.
Risk management enhancement: Refine the use of extreme value theory within GARCH models
  to estimate the probability of extreme market movements more accurately in low volatility
  regimes.
Risk management parameters: Update the existing risk management framework to include
  Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) which considers the severity of tail losses, thereby
  providing a complementary risk perspective during low-volatility periods.
Risk_management: Include a resilience metric within the risk management system that
  quantifies the strategy's ability to recover from losses and dynamically alters
  position sizing in response to changes in this metric.
Streamline mean reversion techniques: Adjust the Kalman Filter parameters to better
  reflect the low volatility environment, allowing for a more responsive adaptation
  to market changes with an emphasis on minimizing false signals.
adaptive regime multiplier mechanism: Adjust the machine learning model's loss function
  to penalize misclassification of the current regime more severely, ensuring greater
  sensitivity to RANGING_LOW_VOL conditions.
conditions - entry: Enhance entry models with advanced anomaly detection mechanisms
  using unsupervised machine learning techniques, responsive to abnormal intraday
  volume and price changes.
current rules prompt - parameters: Adjust the adaptive mutation rate to be dependent
  on strategy performance deviation rather than a generic success rate, thus improving
  the algorithm's ability to respond to the current market.
regime_specific_rules: Integrate dynamic weighting adjustments into the strategy based
  on recent performance and evolving correlations, using a multi-armed bandit approach.
risk management parameters: Refine the risk model to include a cascading stop loss
  system that reacts in real-time to changes in market volatility, order flow pace,
  and spread dynamics, for a more nuanced and responsive set of risk parameters.
risk_management: Institute a multi-faceted risk metric system that combines traditional
  and behavioral-economic indicators to gauge strategy resilience and adjust position
  sizing algorithms accordingly.
risk_management enhancement: Incorporate backtesting of historical low-volatility
  events into the Expectiles-based VaR model to better predict strategy responses
  and quicker adapt to similar future market conditions.
risk_management rules for RANGING_LOW_VOL regime: Introduce liquidity-adjusted risk
  metrics that account for the asset's trading volume and spread, allowing for tighter
  control over position exposure in RANGING_LOW_VOL conditions.
risk_management_parameters: Create a portfolio risk adjustment mechanism that incorporates
  a live economic news feed for event-driven risk recalibration, complementing technical
  indicators and sentiment-based inputs.
streamline mean reversion techniques: Incorporate adaptive optimization techniques,
  like grid or random searches, to fine-tune mean reversion models, enabling better
  alignment with current market characteristics.
system: Streamline the systematic feedback loop to not only revise Differential Evolution
  parameters but also dynamically adapt entry and exit rules based on leading indicators
  of volatility and inter-market analysis, enhancing the strategy's sensitivity to
  shifts in market regime.
