  strategy robustness and define a mechanism to adjust parameters dynamically based
  on their impact on performance.
New section after strategy_prompt: Introduce a systematic method for reassessing the
  performance and viability of the strategy at regular intervals, by incorporating
  a rolling out-of-sample performance review in order to detect and reduce the risk
  of strategy degradation over time.
Risk management enhancement: Refine the use of extreme value theory within GARCH models
  to estimate the probability of extreme market movements more accurately in low volatility
  regimes.
Risk management parameters: Update the existing risk management framework to include
  Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) which considers the severity of tail losses, thereby
  providing a complementary risk perspective during low-volatility periods.
Risk_management: Include a resilience metric within the risk management system that
  quantifies the strategy's ability to recover from losses and dynamically alters
  position sizing in response to changes in this metric.
Streamline mean reversion techniques: Optimize mean reversion strategies by incorporating
  machine learning algorithms that can identify short-term anomalies and statistically
  significant price reversals within the low volatility regime.
adaptive regime multiplier mechanism: Further refine the Bayesian optimization process
  to detect shifts in market regimes with higher precision, particularly focusing
  on identifying the transition into and out of low volatility states.
current rules prompt - parameters: Adjust the adaptive mutation rate to be dependent
  on strategy performance deviation rather than a generic success rate, thus improving
  the algorithm's ability to respond to the current market.
end of current rules prompt: Apply adaptive market filters that utilize high-frequency
  trading data to more accurately detect regime shifts, thereby providing timely strategy
  adjustments to different phases of the RANGING_LOW_VOL regime.
regime_specific_rules: Implement an adaptive regime detection mechanism using clustering
  techniques to identify subtle shifts within the low volatility regime, allowing
  for fine-grained strategy adjustments.
risk management parameters: Refine the risk model to include a cascading stop loss
  system that reacts in real-time to changes in market volatility, order flow pace,
  and spread dynamics, for a more nuanced and responsive set of risk parameters.
risk_management: Develop a real-time risk assessment methodology that takes into account
  the evolving covariance among different asset classes and dynamically adjusts capital
  allocation to optimize the trade-off between risk and return.
risk_management enhancement: Enhance GARCH models with a focus on tail risk protection
  by incorporating stress testing and scenario analysis specific to low-volatility
  environments.
risk_management parameters: Refine the risk management approach by integrating a multi-factor
  model that assesses risks from volatility clustering, liquidity gaps, and extreme
  price movements, adjusting stop losses and position sizes accordingly.
risk_management rules for RANGING_LOW_VOL regime: Incorporate a dynamic liquidity
  assessment tool that evaluates the market depth and adjusts risk levels accordingly,
  ensuring that position sizes are always aligned with the current market's ability
  to absorb trade volume without significant impact.

  hypothetical worst-case scenarios specific to low volatility markets to ensure robustness
  and preparedness for sudden market shifts.
system: Enhance the systematic feedback loop with a focus on magnitude and frequency
  of market moves to better capture the nuances of a RANGING_LOW_VOL regime, adjusting
  entry and exit rules accordingly.
