entry_zones and exit_zones: Deploy reinforcement learning methods to enable the pattern
  recognition algorithms to learn and adapt from each trade executed, focusing on
  maximizing rewards in the form of profitable trades during RANGING_LOW_VOL market
  regimes.
opportunity_description: Incorporate a dynamic thresholding system into historical
  mean reversion strategies that modulates parameters like volatility bands in real-time
  based on current market phase information, enhancing responsiveness to market changes.
regime_change_probability: Integrate real-time text analytics of financial news to
  complement the multi-factor volatility and volume regime detection system, thereby
  increasing sensitivity to events that may signal regime changes.
risk_management_notes: Implement a volatility forecasting model that uses market data
  combined with leading indicators to predict potential volatility spikes. Adapt liquidity
  risk assessments dynamically by assessing real-time capital flows between related
  assets.
suggested_position_size: Employ machine learning techniques to continuously analyze
  the market conditions and player behaviors, ensuring the suggested position size
  is always optimized for the prevailing market depth and volatility.
