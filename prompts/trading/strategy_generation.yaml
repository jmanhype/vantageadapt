entry_zones and exit_zones: Prioritize mean reversion strategies and statistical arbitrage
  techniques that are better suited for non-trending, low volatility markets, using indicators 
  like Bollinger Band width combined with MACD histogram slopes, and set exact numerical 
  thresholds for these indicators to refine entry and exit points.
opportunity_description: Refine the random perturbation tests module with a dynamic
  volatility envelope that adjusts based on real-time market liquidity, recent historical
  volatility, and the market's regime to improve shock range accuracy.
opportunity_description after 'dynamic volatility envelope': Integrate adaptive learning
  algorithms such as online boosting and adaptive filtering, which can update predictive
  models in real-time based on new data without retraining from scratch, enhancing
  strategy responsiveness to market dynamics.
'opportunity_description: [after ''''dynamic volatility envelope'''']': Employ a more
  granular analysis of historical data through clustering methods to distinguish between
  subtly different low volatility scenarios, rather than relying solely on kernel
  density estimation, to achieve finer strategy tuning.
opportunity_description adjustment: Introduce precise volatility thresholds that,
  when crossed, trigger strategic adjustments, supported by real-time data from volatility
  indexes and proprietary indicators.
risk_management_notes: Incorporate adaptive risk control rules that scale exposure
  based on the success or failure of recent trades, as well as prevailing market liquidity
  and volatility indicators, with a dynamic sentiment decay factor that accounts for the
  skewness and kurtosis of short-term returns.
suggested_position_size: Adopt an adaptive position sizing algorithm that factors
  in the volatility-adjusted Sharpe ratio, VIX levels, and market-specific volatility,
  utilizing Bayesian methods to update position sizes in response to evolving market 
  conditions and strategy performance.
