Current Strategy Prompt: Incorporate a market regime detection system that utilizes
  a combination of LSTM networks for time-series analysis and convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) for pattern recognition to enhance the prediction of market regime
  shifts.
Current Strategy Prompt Focus areas: Restructure the optimization constraints to prioritize
  achieving a minimum win rate of 0.4 before targeting a Sortino ratio above 2.0,
  due to the current failure in meeting the win rate requirement.
Current Strategy Prompt Volatility-based strategy adaptation: Integrate a real-time
  volatility assessment that accurately adapts the ATR to varying market conditions
  and apply it on a granular level to individual trades.
Enhance the multi-objective optimization model: Include an objective to decrease the
  maximum drawdown, an essential aspect for strategies focusing on RANGING_LOW_VOL
  regimes where capital preservation is critical in the face of small price movements.
Focus areas: Expand the use of a multi-objective optimization framework to balance
  the trade-off between win rate and total return, specifically including constraints
  that ensure a Sortino ratio above 2.0 and a win rate enhancement to meet the minimum
  requirement of 0.4.
Focus areas for RANGING_LOW_VOL regime (in system): Implement a dynamic scaling system
  based on the Kelly criterion to adjust position sizes in relation to the probability
  of win and the risk-reward ratio, while ensuring compliance with the preset Sortino
  ratio and win rate requirements.
Improve the win rate focus area: Implement machine learning techniques like cluster
  analysis to categorize losing trades and identify nuanced patterns that lead to
  strategy underperformance.
Market Regime Classification System: Incorporate reinforced learning that allows the
  system to dynamically adjust weightings on different classification parameters based
  on their predictive success over time.
Methodology for sentiment indicator weighting: Refine methodology to include sentiment
  indicators like market news, social media analytics, and economic calendar events
  to provide comprehensive sentiment analysis especially tailored for low volatility
  regimes.
Real-time volatility assessment: Provide a comparison of latency and computational
  efficiency between ARIMA/GARCH and LSTM, recommending the most appropriate model
  for real-time volatility assessment in a RANGING_LOW_VOL market.
Redefine multi-objective optimization: Introduce a dynamic optimization algorithm
  capable of adjusting weights in real-time for multiple objectives to quickly respond
  to sudden changes in market conditions.
Regime classification system: Outline a comprehensive update procedure for regime
  classification that includes new data inputs like inter-market correlations and
  order book dynamics, which should be periodically refined to improve their predictive
  capabilities in RANGING_LOW_VOL conditions.
Risk-reward adjustment rules: Develop a model for position size and risk exposure
  adjustments based on the equity curve filtering, ensuring that the strategy systematically
  lowers position size during losing streaks, with explicit rules tied to performance
  metrics.
Sentiment analysis layer description: Expand the sentiment analysis to utilize NLP
  techniques on news headlines and social media posts to gauge market sentiment and
  its potential impact on the low volatility market regime.
Volatility Level: Develop a more sophisticated regime classification system that uses
  machine learning techniques to determine current market regimes by training on historical
  price and volatility data.
Volatility-based strategy adaptation: Introduce a dual-adaptation strategy that adjusts
  trading parameters both pre- and post-trade entry. Pre-entry, use a more sophisticated
  market regime determination that considers real-time volatility. Post-entry, apply
  a dynamic trailing stop that adjusts to real-time market fluctuations.
Volatility-based strategy adaptation focus area: Integrate a feedback loop from execution
  metrics back into the strategy adaptation component, to refine responses to market
  changes based on actual performance data.
regime classification system: Suggest specific alternative data sources for inter-market
  correlations and order book dynamics, such as relative strength of correlated assets
  and real-time bid/ask pressure.
risk-reward adjustment rules: Introduce a rule-based tiered approach for scaling position
  sizes and adjusting risk-reward ratios based on the evolving confidence level of
  a trade setup, derived from real-time analytics and performance history.
sentiment analysis layer description: Refine the sentiment analysis model for low
  volatility regimes by incorporating domain-specific data and considering alternative
  data sources for machine learning features, such as volatility indices, global news
  sentiment, and monetary policy announcements.
