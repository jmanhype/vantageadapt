entry_zones and exit_zones: Test a combination of decision trees, support vector machines
  (SVM), and Random Forests, selecting the best performer through cross-validation,
  as they potentially provide complementary insights in a ranging low volatility market.
opportunity_description: Refine the random perturbation tests module with a dynamic
  volatility envelope that adjusts based on real-time market liquidity, recent historical
  volatility, and the market's regime to improve shock range accuracy.
opportunity_description after 'dynamic volatility envelope': Implement Bayesian optimization
  to fine-tune shock ranges during perturbation tests, utilizing a continuous learning
  model that adapts to recurring market conditions for improved strategy robustness.
'opportunity_description: [after ''dynamic volatility envelope'']': Tailor the randomness
  within perturbation tests to prefer historically successful trade ranges during
  similar market conditions, using kernel density estimation.
risk_management_notes: Develop an algorithm for parsing and quantifying sentiment
  from key economic reports and high-impact news events, employing natural language
  processing (NLP) to ensure relevance and timeliness of the incorporated data.
suggested_position_size: Employ a risk parity framework to derive suggested position
  sizes, considering the VIX, market breadth indicators, and asset-specific volatility,
  to achieve a more balanced risk distribution.
