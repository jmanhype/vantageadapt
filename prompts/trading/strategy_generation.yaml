'''opportunity_description: [after ''''dynamic volatility envelope'''']''': Adjust
  the randomness within perturbation tests to create a more sophisticated model that
  filters noise and focuses on robust patterns in low-volatility markets.
entry_zones and exit_zones: Refine the decision models by incorporating a feature
  engineering process that emphasizes regime-specific indicators prevalent in RANGING_LOW_VOL
  conditions to enhance the prediction accuracy for entry and exit zones.
opportunity_description: Implement an adaptive filter adjustment mechanism that is
  more nuanced in identifying potential trades specifically during low-volatility,
  range-bound markets.
opportunity_description adjustment: Include volatility thresholds that trigger adjustments
  in strategy sensitivity more granularly, by describing specific values from volatility
  indexes or proprietary indicators tailored to RANGING_LOW_VOL conditions.
opportunity_description after 'dynamic volatility envelope': Precisely define 'robust
  patterns' by outlining specific statistical anomalies, their expected frequency,
  and trade edge magnitude, and provide actionable guidelines for verification within
  the specified confidence interval.
'opportunity_description: [after ''dynamic volatility envelope'']': Tailor the randomness
  within perturbation tests to prefer historically successful trade ranges during
  similar market conditions, using kernel density estimation.
risk_management_notes: Provide concrete formulae for the 'dynamic sentiment decay
  factor' which should incorporate real-time volatility metrics such as ATR or HVP,
  to fine-tune the responsiveness of risk management based on current market conditions.
suggested_position_size: Define a position sizing formula that dynamically adjusts
  according to VIX levels, recent performance drawdowns, and correlations to major
  benchmarks, ensuring alignment with the RANGING_LOW_VOL regime.
