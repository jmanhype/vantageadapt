'''opportunity_description: [after ''''dynamic volatility envelope'''']''': Adjust
  the randomness within perturbation tests to create a more sophisticated model that
  filters noise and focuses on robust patterns in low-volatility markets.
entry_zones and exit_zones: Use indicators that are specialized for low-volatility
  range-bound markets, like Bollinger Band width combined with MACD histogram slopes,
  and set exact numerical thresholds for these indicators to refine entry and exit
  points.
opportunity_description: Prioritize trading signals that persist for a minimum duration
  to reduce likelihood of false triggers in low-volatility ranges.
opportunity_description [after 'dynamic volatility envelope']: Adjust the model to
  prioritize trading signals that sustain beyond a minimum time threshold, ensuring
  that sporadic noise is less likely to trigger false trades in low-volatility ranges.
opportunity_description adjustment: Introduce precise volatility thresholds that,
  when crossed, trigger strategic adjustments, supported by real-time data from volatility
  indexes and proprietary indicators.
opportunity_description after 'dynamic volatility envelope': Introduce a component
  that utilizes conditional probability models, such as Markov Chain or Bayesian Network,
  to better predict likely market regime shifts from RANGING_LOW_VOL to other market
  conditions.
'opportunity_description: [after ''dynamic volatility envelope'']': Tailor the randomness
  within perturbation tests to prefer historically successful trade ranges during
  similar market conditions, using kernel density estimation.
risk_management_notes: Refine the dynamic sentiment decay factor to account for the
  skewness and kurtosis of short-term returns, enhancing risk management for RANGING_LOW_VOL
  markets.
suggested_position_size: Adopt a dynamic position sizing algorithm which factors in
  both VIX levels and market-specific volatility, with clear numeric parameters fitting
  low-volatility conditions.
